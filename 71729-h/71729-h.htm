<p class="center no-indent fs80">By Popular Authors.</p>

<hr class="r15">

<p class="center no-indent bold">SEVEN DAUGHTERS.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">By Miss <span class="smcap">A. M. Douglas</span>, Author of “In Trust,” “Stephen Dane,” “Claudia,”
“Sydnie Adriance,” “Home Nook,” “Nelly Kennard’s Kingdom.”
12mo, cloth, illustrated. $1.50.</p>

<p>“A charming romance of Girlhood,” full of incident and humor. The “Seven
Daughters” are characters which reappear in some of Miss Douglas’ later books. In
this book they form a delightful group, hovering on the verge of Womanhood, with
all the little perplexities of home life and love dreams as incidentals, making a fresh and
attractive story.</p>


<p class="center no-indent bold">OUR HELEN.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">By <span class="smcap">Sophie May</span>. 12mo, cloth, illustrated. $1.50.</p>

<p>“The story is a very attractive one, as free from the sensational and impossible as
could be desired, and at the same time full of interest, and pervaded by the same bright,
cheery sunshine that we find in the author’s earlier books. She is to be congratulated
on the success of her essay in a new field of literature, to which she will be warmly welcomed
by those who know and admire her ‘Prudy Books.’”—<cite>Graphic.</cite></p>


<p class="center no-indent bold">THE ASBURY TWINS.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">By <span class="smcap">Sophie May</span>, Author of “The Doctor’s Daughter,” “Our Helen,” &amp;c. 12mo,
cloth, illustrated. $1.50.</p>

<p>“Has the ring of genuine genius, and the sparkle of a gem of the first water. We
read it one cloudy winter day, and it was as good as a Turkish bath, or a three hours’
soak in the sunshine.”—<cite>Cooperstown Republican.</cite></p>


<p class="center no-indent bold">THAT QUEER GIRL.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">By Miss <span class="smcap">Virginia F. Townsend</span>, Author of “Only Girls,” &amp;c. 12mo, cloth, illustrated.
$1.50.</p>

<p>Queer only in being unconventional, brave and frank, an “old-fashioned girl,” and
very sweet and charming. As indicated in the title, is a little out of the common track,
and the wooing and the winning are as queer as the heroine. The <cite>New Haven
Register</cite> says: “Decidedly the best work which has appeared from the pen of Miss
Townsend.”</p>


<p class="center no-indent bold">RUNNING TO WASTE.</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><b>The Story of a Tomboy.</b> By <span class="smcap">George M. Baker</span>. 16mo, cloth, illustrated.
$1.50.</p>

<p>“This book is one of the most entertaining we have read for a long time. It is well
written, full of humor, and good humor, and it has not a dull or uninteresting page.
It is lively and natural, and overflowing with the best New England character and
traits. There is also a touch of pathos, which always accompanies humor, in the life
and death of the tomboy’s mother.”—<cite>Newburyport Herald.</cite></p>


<p class="center no-indent bold">DAISY TRAVERS;</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><b>Or the Girls of Hive Hall</b>. By <span class="smcap">Adelaide F. Samuels</span>, Author of “Dick and
Daisy Stories,” “Dick Travers Abroad,” &amp;c. 16mo, cloth, illustrated. $1.50.</p>

<p>The story of Hive Hall is full of life and action, and told in the same happy
style which made the earlier life of its heroine so attractive, and caused the Dick and
Daisy books to become great favorites with the young. What was said of the younger
books can, with equal truth, be said of Daisy grown up.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Another</span> girl!”</p>

<p>“Seven of ’em!”</p>

<p>“What a pity!”</p>

<p>“The land sakes alive! Brother Endicott will
have to buy calico by the piece for their gowns!
He might get a little throwed off, or a spool of
cotton extry. He, he! ho, ho! Well, children
are a great risk! You don’t s’pose there’ll be a
donation party right away—do you!”</p>

<p>“There is donation enough for the present, I
think; and the sewing society will not be called
upon.”</p>

<p>I liked that soft, silvery voice of Mrs. Whitcomb.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
It was just like her pretty light hair,
beginning to be plentifully sprinkled with silver,
and her clear peachy skin, that was just a little
wrinkled. Her touch was so gentle, her motions
so graceful and pleasing!</p>

<p>“I was only joking about it. They’ll miss
her in the s’ciety—that’s what they will.”</p>

<p>Aunt Letty Perkins was—dreadful! a thorn
in the flesh; a sort of bitter, puckery presence,
as if you had just tasted an unripe persimmon.</p>

<p>“And it’ll be a puzzle to get husbands for
’em all. That’s the most unfort’net thing about
girls.”</p>

<p>I suppose she meant <em>us</em>, not the society. My
face was in a blaze of indignation. Then the
door was shut, and I went on with my dusting.</p>

<p>It was a sunny April morning, and a pair of
swallows were twittering about the windows.</p>

<p>Another girl and there <em>were</em> seven of us. Some
one in the parish had said that Mrs. Endicott
would always be sure of a Sunday school class,
for she could fill it up with her own children.
I couldn’t help wishing that there was just <em>one</em>
boy among us, even if it were that wee bairnie
they had been discussing. Boys are nice—in
some ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>I don’t know that I should have modified my
opinion so suddenly but for two things. My eye
happened to fall on my pretty pearl paper-cutter,
that had been sent to me at Christmas.
On one side of the handle was my monogram,
done in scarlet and gold, on the other a little
trail of blue forget-me-nots. A few weeks ago
Harry Denham had been in spending the evening
with us,—that means Fan and I, the elders.
He and Fanny were having a little scrimmage,
and, in a half tragic manner, he seized my pretty
gift, pretending to arm himself with a dagger,
and, somehow, in the <em>melee</em>, the poor thing
snapped in twain.</p>

<p>Hal was very sorry. Then he had such great,
beseeching brown eyes, that when he turned them
so appealingly to me, I pitied him more than I
did myself. It was very foolish, I know. I
ought to have scolded. I should have said,—</p>

<p>“You great, rough, careless boy! now see
what you have done! I wish you would never
come here again!”</p>

<p>“I can get it mended, I know. There is
some beautiful white cement used for such articles.
O, Rose, I am <em>so</em> sorry! I’d get you
another one, only it wouldn’t be <em>it</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind,” I said, meekly, with a wonderful
tendency towards tears, though whether
they would have been for Harry, or the knife,
or myself, I could not exactly tell.</p>

<p>So he had it mended, and it <em>looked</em> as good
as new. But little Frank Mortimer came to call
with his mother, and brought it to grief again.</p>

<p>The other event that reconciled me to the
advent of my little sister, whom I had not yet
seen, was Tabby, who sprang up on the window
sill, with her cunning salutation, like three or
four n’s, strung together in a prolonged musical
fashion, not quite a mew. I don’t want you to
think the word back there was meant for a pun,
for it wasn’t. I’ll tell you in the beginning that
I am not a bit bright, or sharp, or funny. I
have even heard jokes that I did not see the
point of until the next day.</p>

<p>Tabby is just as beautiful as she can be. A
Maltese cat, with a white nose and two white
front paws. She is very cunning, and knows
almost everything within the domain of cat
knowledge. If there is one thing I do love better
than another, in the way of pets, it is cats.
A clean-faced, sleek cat, sitting on the hearth-rug
before the grate, is enough to give the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
household a feeling of contentment. Then the
kittens are always so funny and frolicksome!</p>

<p>“Tabby,” I said, as she arched her back and
rubbed her head against my sleeve,—“Tabby,
<em>you</em> wouldn’t be half so happy if there was a
boy in the house. He would lift you by the
tail, turn your ears back, put walnut shells on
your feet, and make you dance on your hind
legs. Then he would be forever tormenting
your kittens. Boys are bad naturally. Maybe
they are born so, and can’t help it,” I continued,
reflectively. “I suppose they <em>do</em> have a
good deal more of the old Adam in them than
girls, because, you see, we inherit Eve’s propensity
to curiosity; but then boys are fully as
curious—aren’t they, Tabby? and as full of
curiosity!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Tabby.</p>

<p>She says it as plainly as you do. In fact, we
sometimes hold quite lengthy conversations.</p>

<p>“So we don’t care—do we? If Aunt Letty
Perkins would not make such a row about it!
How would <em>she</em> like to have a lot of boys, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>Tabby shook her head sagely, and scratched
her left ear. I knew she felt just the same as
I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>I finished the parlor, and shut down the windows.
Then I went to papa’s study, took the
ashes softly out of the grate, and laid another
fire, in case the evening should be cool, picked
up papers and magazines, and dusted with the
very lightest of touches. It was my part of the
work to look after the study. I was so glad to
be able to suit papa!</p>

<p>Just then the door opened. It was papa himself,
fresh from a walk. <em>I</em> think him ever and
ever so handsome, though sometimes I wish he
was not quite so thin. He is rather tall, has a
fine chest and shoulders; but it is his sweet,
dear old face that I like so much. It’s a little
wrinkled, to be sure, and may be his mouth <em>is</em> a
trifle wide. I never considered it any defect,
however, for he shuts his lips together with such
a cordial smile! He has lovely deep-gray eyes,
and his hair, which was once a bright brown,
begins to be toned with silvery threads, as well
as his soft brown beard, which he wears full,
except a mustache.</p>

<p>“O, papa!” I cried, clasping my arms around
his neck, “<em>are</em> you very sorry?”</p>

<p>“Sorry for what, my daughter?” And he
looked a good deal surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“That we haven’t a boy. There are so many
of us girls!”</p>

<p>“My dear, I have always had a great fancy for
little girls, as you know. And we take whatever
God sends. She is very pretty.”</p>

<p>“O, you dear, blessed papa!”</p>

<p>“You will have to be the mother now, for a
little while, Rose. You must try to manage the
children nicely.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I will do my best. Papa, do you
not believe that I could go in and see her?
Aunt Letty Perkins is there.”</p>

<p>“O, how could Mrs. Whitcomb! Yes; come
along, child.”</p>

<p>I followed him to the sitting-room. The Rectory
was a great, rambling old house, with a
wide hall through the middle. Back of the parlor,
quite shut off, indeed, were the dining-room
and the two kitchens; on the other side,
study, sitting-room, nursery, and mamma’s sleeping
apartment.</p>

<p>Mamma’s door was shut. Mrs. Whitcomb was
wise enough to keep guard over that. There
was a little fire in the Franklin stove, and before
it sat Mrs. Perkins, though everybody called
her Aunt Letty. Her feet were on the fender,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
her brown stuff dress turned up over her knees,
her black alpaca skirt not quite so high, and a
faded quilted petticoat taking the heat of the
fire. She always wore substantial gray yarn
stockings in the winter, and lead-colored cotton
in summer, except on state occasions. Her bonnet
was always a little awry, and the parting
of her hair invariably crooked. I’m sure I don’t
know what she did, except to attend to other
people’s affairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Downs was beside her, a helpless-looking
little fat woman, who, Fan declared, looked like
a feather pillow with a checked apron tied around
it. She was always out of breath, had always
just left her work, and was never going to stay
more than a moment.</p>

<p>“O, brother Endicott!” exclaimed Aunt Letty,
reaching her hand out so far that she nearly
tipped her chair over; “I s’spose you ought to
be congrat<em>your</em>lated.” (She always put <em>your</em> in
the word, and always said <em>equi</em>nomical, regardless
of Noah Webster.) “What does the Bible
say about a man having his quiver full of olive
branches? or is it that they sit round the table?
now I disremember. I don’t go much according
to Old Testament. It was well enough for them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
heathenish Jews and the old times; but I want
the livin’ breathin’ gospel. What you goin’ to
call her?”</p>

<p>Papa smiled, at the absurd transition, I suppose.
Fan said Aunt Letty had only one resemblance
to a dictionary—she changed her
subjects without any warning.</p>

<p>“Would Keren-happuch do?” papa asked,
with a droll twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“O, now, Mr. Endicott!”</p>

<p>“It’s a nice little thing,” put in Mrs. Downs.
“Favors its mar I think.”</p>

<p>“Come and see it, Rose.—May we, Mrs.
Whitcomb?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, indeed,” with her sweet smile.</p>

<p>She led me to the corner of the room, between
the stove and mamma’s door. There, on
two chairs, was a tiny bed, and under the
blanket a tiny baby with a broad forehead,
black, silky hair, a cunning little mouth, but no
nose to speak of. Yet she <em>was</em> pretty. I thought
I should like to squeeze her to a jelly, and
cover her with kisses, though I don’t know as
that would be orthodox jelly-cake for any but a
cannibal.</p>

<p>Papa glanced at her with a tender smile, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
sighed. Perhaps he was thinking of the long
way the little feet would have to travel. It is
a great journey, after all, from the City of Destruction
to the New Jerusalem. Something in
the baby-face brought to mind Christiana and the
children.</p>

<p>“Great pity ’tisn’t a boy,” persisted Aunt
Letty.</p>

<p>“O, I don’t know about that. They are so
handy to take one another’s clothes,” said papa,
humorously.</p>

<p>“To be sure. But yours could be cut over,”
returned the literal woman.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that I shall always need mine
to the last thread. I have lost the trick of outgrowing
them. O, have you heard that Mrs.
Bowers’s sister has come from the west? Arrived
last evening.”</p>

<p>“Land sakes alive! Why, I guess I’ll run
right over. Sally and me was thick as peas in
our young days. And her husband’s been a
what you call it out there, senate, or constitution,
or something.”</p>

<p>“Member of the legislature,” corrected father,
quietly.</p>

<p>“O, yes. Some folks <em>do</em> get along. There’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the middle of my needle. I should knit there
if the house was afire!”</p>

<p>She brushed down her skirts, put her knitting
in her satchel, jerked her shawl up, and pinned
it, and settled her old black bonnet more askew
than ever. Mrs. Whitcomb kindly pulled it
straight for her.</p>

<p>“Thank’ee. If you want any help, Mrs. Whitcomb,
send right straight over. Ministers are
always the chosen of the Lord, and I feel as if
one ought to come at their call.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged,” returned Mrs. Whitcomb,
in her quiet, lady-like way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Downs took her departure at the same
moment. There was a great bustle, and talking;
but father finally succeeded in getting them to
the porch. When Aunt Letty was safely off the
steps, she turned and said,—</p>

<p>“I’m glad you are so well satisfied, Mr. Endicott.
It’s a sure sign of grace to take thankfully
what the Lord sends.”</p>

<p>“O, dear,” said papa, with a sigh; “I am
afraid I don’t give thanks for <em>quite</em> everything.
‘Tribulation worketh patience.’ But didn’t those
women almost set you crazy? If I thought
another sermon on bridling the tongue would do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
any good; I should preach it next Sunday.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitcomb smiled and said, in her cool,
silvery voice,—</p>

<p>“It takes a great deal of powder and shot to
kill a man in battle, and it takes a great deal
of preaching to save a soul.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I get almost discouraged when I find
how strong the old Adam is in human souls.”</p>

<p>I looked at papa rather reproachfully; but just
then he opened the door of mamma’s room, and
called me thither.</p>

<p>Mamma was very sweet and lovely. She kissed
me many times, and hoped I would prove a
trusty house-keeper, and see that papa had everything
he needed, especially to notice that his
cuffs and handkerchiefs were clean, and that he
was in nice order on Sunday.</p>

<p>“And—did I like the baby?” She asked it
almost bashfully.</p>

<p>“It is just as sweet as it can be. I only wish
it was large enough to hold and to carry about.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear.”</p>

<p>Years afterwards I knew what that meant.</p>

<p>I went out to the kitchen to see about the
dinner. We never had regular servants like
other people. It was the lame, and the halt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and the blind, and the ignorant, metaphorically
speaking. Papa brought them home and mamma
took pity on them. Now it was Becky Sill, a
great, overgrown girl of sixteen, whose intemperate
father had just died in the poorhouse,
where the three younger children—boys—were
waiting for a chance to be put out to the farmers.</p>

<p>“Look at this ’ere floor, Miss Rose! I’ve
scrubbed it white as snow. And I’ve been a
peelin’ of pertaters.”</p>

<p>“<em>This</em> floor is sufficient, Becky; and <em>peeling</em>,
and <em>potatoes</em>.”</p>

<p>“O, law, you’re just like your mother. Some
people are born ladies and have fine ways. I
wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“You have been very industrious,” I returned,
cheerfully; and then I went at the dinner.</p>

<p>The hungry, noisy troop came home from
school. What if they were <em>all</em> boys!</p>

<p>Do you want a photograph of us? I was
past seventeen, not very tall, with a round sort
of figure, and dimples everywhere in my face,
where one could have been put by accident or
design. My skin was fair, my hair—that was
my sore point. I may as well tell the truth;
it <em>was</em> red, a sort of deep mahogany red, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
curled. My features were just passable. So,
you see, I was not likely to set up for a beauty.
Fan was sixteen, taller than I, slender, blonde,
with saucy blue eyes and golden hair, and given
to rather coquettish ways. Nelly was fourteen,
almost as tall as I, with papa’s gray eyes,—only
hers had a violet tint,—and mamma’s dark hair.
Daisy was next, eleven, and on the blonde order.
Lily, whose name was Elizabeth, and Tim, aged
seven. Her real cognomen was Gertrude; but
we began to call her Tiny Tim, and the name,
somehow stuck to her. What a host of girls,
to be sure!</p>

<p>“Papa,” I said that evening, going to the
study for a good night kiss, where he was writing
in the quiet,—“papa, <em>are</em> you sorry to have
so many girls?”</p>

<p>I had been exercised on the subject all day,
and I wanted to dispose of it before I slept.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear! no;” with a sweet gravity.</p>

<p>“But, papa,”—and I stumbled a little,—“it
isn’t likely that—that—we shall all—get married—”</p>

<p>I could not proceed any farther, and hid my
face on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Married! What ever put such an absurd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
idea into your head, Rosalind? A parcel of
children—married!”</p>

<p>I knew papa was displeased, or he would never
have called me Rosalind.</p>

<p>“O, dear papa, don’t be angry!” I cried.
“I was not thinking of being married, I’m sure.
I don’t believe any one will ever like me very
much, because my hair is red, and I may be fat
as Mrs. Downs. And if I should be an old
maid,—and I know I shall,—I want you to
love me a little; and if I’m queer and fussy,
and all that, you must be patient with me. I will
try to do my best always.”</p>

<p>“My dear darling! what a foolish little thing
you are! Some of the old women have been
talking to you, I know. I shall certainly have
to turn the barrel upside down, and find the
sermon on bridling the tongue. You are all
little girls, and I will not have the bloom rudely
rubbed off of my peaches. There don’t cry about
it;” and he kissed my wet face so tenderly that
I <em>did</em> cry more than ever.</p>

<p>“My little girl, I want us to have a good
many years of happiness together,” he said, with
solemn tenderness. “Put all these things out of
your head, and love your mother and me, and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
your duty in that state of life to which it shall
please God to call you. I want you to be like
Martin Luther’s bird, who sat on the tree and
sang, and let God think for him. And now,
run to bed, for I wish to finish this sermon
while I am in the humor.”</p>

<p>I kissed him many, many times. I was so
sure of his sweet, never-failing love. And I
suppose fathers and mothers never <em>do</em> get tired
of us!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was a bright June morning. The windows
were all open; the birds were singing,
and the air was sweet with out-of-door
smells. Waving grasses, hosts of flowers, rose
and honeysuckle out on the porch in the very
height of riotous living, each trying to outbloom
the other.</p>

<p>We were at breakfast. We never had this
meal very early at the Rectory. On summer
mornings papa loved to get up and take a stroll,
and botanize a little. Mamma rose, looked after
Becky, and took a quiet supervision of us all.
I helped dress the three younger children, for
Fan usually had some lessons on hand, as she
was still in school. By the time we were ready
papa would be back. Then we sang a verse or
two of a hymn, said the Lord’s prayer together,
and papa pronounced the greater benediction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
over us. It was so short, simple, and enjoyable!
Somehow I do not think children take naturally
to prayers, unless they are rendered very sweet
and attractive. We were allowed sufficient time
to get wide awake before coming to breakfast.
Mamma was at the head of the table again,
looking as sweet as a new pink. Papa’s place
was at the foot. Fan and I sat opposite each
other, about half way down. She poured the
water and the milk. I had the three younger
children on my side, and spread their bread or
biscuits for them. I used to think of Goethe’s
Charlotte, only she had brothers as well as sisters.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o’clock. Lemmy Collins
came up with the mail. There had been a
shower the evening before, and none of us had
gone for it.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed papa, “we are bountifully
supplied this morning. One for Nelly, two for
mamma, and two for me.”</p>

<p>“O, what elegant writing!” said Nell, leaning
over to look at papa’s.</p>

<p>“Yes;” slowly. “I cannot think;” and papa
fell into a brown study.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you open it?” asked bright-eyed
Daisy; “then you won’t have to think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“To be sure, little wisdom!” and papa
smiled. “I will look over this thin one first,
though.”</p>

<p>That was only an invitation to a meeting of
the clergy. We were all watching to see him
open the letter par excellence. He took out his
penknife and cut round the seal, which he
handed to Tim.</p>

<p>“W—h—y!” lengthening the word out indefinitely.
“From Stephen Duncan!” Then he
read on in thoughtful silence, now and then
knitting his brows.</p>

<p>Mamma’s letters were from an aunt and a
cousin, with some kindly messages for us all.</p>

<p>“Girls,” said father, with a sudden start,
“would you like to have some brothers large
enough to keep their hands and faces clean, and
strong enough to help you garden?”</p>

<p>“Boys are a nuisance!” declared Nell.</p>

<p>“Well, I have an offer of two. One is something
of an invalid, though. My wards, I suppose,
for that matter; though I have never considered
myself much of a guardian, since Stephen
was old enough to look after the boys. Then I
always thought their uncle, James Duncan, <em>was</em>
annoyed at my being put in at all. It seems he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
died very suddenly, a month ago, in London.
Stephen has to go over and settle his affairs,
and he wants me to keep the boys. Rose, pass
this letter up to your mother.”</p>

<p>“How old are they?” asked Fan.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say. Louis is ready to enter
college, but has studied himself out, and will
have to go to the country. Stuart is—a boy, I
suppose. I have not seen them since their father
died.”</p>

<p>“Poor boys!” said mamma. “And Stephen
is coming. Why, he will be here to-morrow
afternoon. This letter has been delayed on its
way;” and mamma glanced at the date and the
postmark.</p>

<p>The children were through, and we rose from
the table. There was a perfect hubbub of questions
then. Lily swung on father’s arm, while
Tim took a leg, and they were all eagerness to
know about the brothers.</p>

<p>“Mamma will have to consider the subject,”
he said. “Come, let us go out and look at the
flower-beds. I dare say the rain brought up a
regiment of weeds last night.”</p>

<p>Fanny went to put her room in order; Nelly
had some buttons to sew on her school dress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and followed mamma to the nursery. Becky
came in and helped take the dishes to the
kitchen; while I went to my chambers up stairs.</p>

<p>I hurried a little, I must confess. Then I
bundled the youngsters off to school, and ran
into the nursery. Mamma was washing and
dressing baby.</p>

<p>“What about the boys?” I asked. “Will
they really come? Should you like to have
them?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be as well for you to read
the letter, Rose. You are old enough to be
taken into family council. It seems so odd, too!
Only last evening papa and I were talking
about—”</p>

<p>Mamma made so long a pause that I glanced
up from the letter, having only read the preface,
as one might say. There was a perplexed look
on the sweet face.</p>

<p>“What is it, mamma?” and I knelt beside
her, kissing baby’s fat cheek.</p>

<p>“My dear, I resolved long ago never to burden
my girls with cares and worries before their
time. And yet, it would be so delightful to
have you for a friend! A clergyman’s wife has
to be doubly discreet on some points. Now, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
I was to say to two or three good friends in
the parish, ‘Our circumstances are somewhat
straightened by the recent expenses,’ they would,
no doubt, seek to make it up in some way.
But I have a horror of anything that looks like
begging.”</p>

<p>“O, yes, mamma. Aunt Letty Perkins wondered,
the day after the baby was born, if there
would not be a donation visit.”</p>

<p>Mamma’s sweet face flushed.</p>

<p>“We have managed so far,” she said; “and
everything has gone very pleasantly. Papa is
well loved, and we have a delightful home.
This great old house and garden are worth a
good deal. But I am wandering from my text
into byways and highways. I feel that I should
sometimes like to have a friend to talk to who
would be a sort of second self—”</p>

<p>“O, mamma take me!” I cried.</p>

<p>“I have always wanted to be like an elder
sister to my girls as they grew to womanhood.”</p>

<p>I wanted to cry, and I was resolved not to.
Mamma’s tone was so sweet that it went to my
heart. But to stop myself, I laughed, and exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Fan would say that your hands would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
pretty full if you were going to be a sister to
each one of us. Or you would have to be
divided into infinitesimal pieces.”</p>

<p>“And fourteen girls might not be desirable,
if their father was a clergyman,” she answered,
smilingly.</p>

<p>“So, let us be the best of friends, mamma,
dearest, and you shall tell me your troubles. It
is being so poor, for one, I know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear. Poverty is not always a delightful
guest. Last evening we were resolving ways
and means, and papa proposed to give up the
magazines, and be very careful about his journeys.
But I cannot bear to have <em>him</em> pinch.
And, you see, if we took these boys, the extra
living would not cost us anything to speak of.
Ten weeks would be—two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“O, mamma!”</p>

<p>“It is right that I should consult you about
the work. It will make your duties more arduous.
Then taking strangers into your family is
never <em>quite</em> so pleasant. But go on with the
letter. We will discuss it afterwards.”</p>

<p>I felt drawn so near to mamma by the talk
and the confidence, that at first I could hardly
take the sense of what I was reading. But I
will tell you the story more briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Papa and Mr. Duncan had been very dear
friends for many years; in fact, I believe, since
papa’s boyhood. When Mr. Duncan died he left
papa a small legacy, and some valuable books
and pictures, besides associating him with his
brother in the guardianship of his three boys.
Mr. James Duncan, who was an exceedingly
proud and exclusive man, seemed to resent this,
and treated papa rather coolly. Their business
was done in writing, and papa had never seen
his wards since their father’s funeral.</p>

<p>Stephen had spent one summer at our house
when he was quite a boy. It seemed now that
he preserved the liveliest recollection of my mother’s
kindness and care, and desired very much
to see my father. The taking of the boys he
asked as a great favor, since he would have to
spend all the summer in England; and he appeared
to feel the responsibility of his brothers
very keenly. It was such a nice, kind, gentlemanly
letter, evincing a good deal of thoughtfulness,
and respect for papa; and even where
he spoke of the terms, he did it with so much
delicacy, as if he were fearful that it would not
be sufficient compensation, and proposed to come
and talk the matter over, as he should, no doubt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
need a good deal of advice from papa in the
course of the next few years.</p>

<p>“What a good, sweet letter this is, mamma!”
I said. “It makes me think of papa.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I liked it exceedingly. Papa is greatly
interested with the plan. He thinks it will
help us to straighten up matters, so that we can
begin next fall quite easy in our minds. The
only other thing he could do would be to take
some boys to prepare for college. That is very
wearing. In this we could all help.”</p>

<p>“I hope the boys will be nice,” I said, with
a little misgiving.</p>

<p>“They will be out of doors a great deal, and
certainly ought to behave like gentlemen, since
they have been at the best of schools. You will
have to keep their room in order; there will be
rather more in the way of cooking and deserts;
but Fanny must help a little during vacation.
You see, baby is going to take up much of my
time. But if I thought it would be uncomfortable
for you girls—”</p>

<p>“O, mamma, it will only last such a little
while, after all! And the two hundred dollars—”</p>

<p>“We must not be mercenary, little one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Before we had finished, papa came in again.
We were all on the boys’ side, I could plainly
see.</p>

<p>The next morning I aired the large spare
room, brought out fresh towels, and arranged
some flowers in the vases. There was matting
on the floor, a maple bureau, wash-stand, and
bedstead. The curtains were thin white muslin,
with green blinds outside, which gave the
apartment a pretty, pale tint.</p>

<p>I didn’t mean to put the two boys in this
room when they came. There was another,
opposite, not <em>quite</em> so nice, plenty good enough
for rollicking boys.</p>

<p>Papa went over to the station for Stephen.—Mr.
Duncan, I mean. I wondered why I should
have such an inclination to call him by his
Christian name—a perfect stranger, too. But
when I saw him I was as formal as you please.</p>

<p>As tall as papa, and somewhat stouter, with
a grave and rather impressive air, eyes that
<em>could</em> look you through, a firm mouth, that,
somehow, seemed to me, <em>might</em> be very stern
and pitiless. He had a broad forehead, with
a good deal of fine, dark hair; but, what I
thought very singular, blue eyes, which reminded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
you of a lake in the shade. His side-whiskers
and mustache gave him a very stylish look, and
he was dressed elegantly. Poor papa looked
shabby beside him.</p>

<p>Mamma and the baby, Fanny and I, were on
the wide porch, while the children were playing
croquet on the grassy lawn, though I do so
much like the old-fashioned name of “door-yard.”
Papa introduced him in his homelike,
cordial fashion, and he shook hands in a kind
of stately manner that didn’t seem a bit like his
letter.</p>

<p>He came to me last. I knew he did not like
me. I think you can always tell when any one
is pleased with you. He studied me rather
sharply, and almost frowned a little. I felt that
it was my red hair. And then I colored all
over, put out my hand awkwardly, and wished
I was anywhere out of sight.</p>

<p>“And all the small crowd out there,” said
papa, in so gay a voice that it quite restored
me to composure.</p>

<p>“Really, friend Endicott, I was not prepared
for this.—Why, Mrs. Endicott, how have you
kept your youth and bloom? Why, I am suddenly
conscience-smitten that I have proposed to
add to your cares.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“You will feel easy when you see the inside
of the house. There is plenty of room, plenty;”
and papa laughed.</p>

<p>“You had only a small nest when I visited
you before,” Mr. Duncan said to mother. “But
how very lovely the whole village is! I am so
glad to find such a place for Louis. I hope my
boys will not worry you to death, Mrs. Endicott,
for, somehow, I do not know as I can give up
the idea of sending them here, especially as Mr.
Endicott is their guardian. I think it will do
them both good to be acquainted intimately with
such a man.”</p>

<p>It was all settled then.</p>

<p>“I have wished a great many times that we
had a sister for Louis’s sake. Oddly enough,
my uncle James’s children were all boys, and
Louis is very peculiar in some respects. It is
asking a great deal of you. I understand that
well, and shall appreciate it.”</p>

<p>I knew that I ought to look after Becky and
the supper; so I rose and slipped away.</p>

<p>“Two boys,” I said to myself. “I do not
believe that I shall like them;” and I shook
my head solemnly.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I went</span> out to the kitchen and advised a
few moments with our maid of all work,
and then began to arrange the supper table.
The visitor must sit next to papa, of course, but
not on my side of the table. I did not mean to
have him any nearer than I could help; for, if
he disliked red hair, I would not flirt it under
his eyes. Or, suppose I placed him next to
Fan! She was so carelessly good natured that
he would not be likely to disturb her thoughts.</p>

<p>Mamma took the baby to the nursery, and then
came in to give an approving look. I placed
the two tall vases of flowers on the table, and
it did present a very pretty appearance.</p>

<p>“We are all ready now,” she said. “Call
papa.”</p>

<p>I rang the bell, and the children came trooping
in, papa and Mr. Duncan bringing up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
rear. Fan glanced at the places, and looked
pleased, I thought.</p>

<p>“Here Mr. Duncan,” she said, with a pretty
wave of her hand; and he took the proffered
seat, giving me a quick glance, that brought the
warm blood to my cheeks.</p>

<p>We had a merry time; for, after all, strangers
were no great rarity; and we were always
merry in our snug little nest. It was said
through the parish that every one had a good
time at our house; and Mr. Duncan appeared
to be no exception. When we were almost
through, we began to say verses, each one repeating
a passage of Scripture commencing with
the same letter. We caught Mr. Duncan right
away. He commenced two or three before he
could hit upon the right beginning.</p>

<p>“You see, I am not very ready with my
wits,” he said, laughingly.</p>

<p>Lily, Daisy, and Tim always had a romp with
papa afterwards; but my duties were not ended
until they were snugly tucked in bed. You see,
we could not afford nurse-maids and all that on
papa’s salary. But then, frolicking with them
in bed was such a delight that I never minded
the knots in their shoestrings, and the loads of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
trash that had to be emptied out of their pockets,
to say nothing of mischief and dawdling,
and the heaps of dresses and skirts lying round
in little pyramids. Now and then I would make
some stringent rules: every child must hang up
her clothes, take care of her shoes and stockings,
and put her comb and hair-ribbon just where
they could be found in the morning. But, somehow,
the rules were never kept. I suppose I
was a poor disciplinarian.</p>

<p>I went down stairs at length. Mr. Duncan
was pacing the porch alone. Papa had been
called to see a sick neighbor. Mamma was
listening to poor old Mrs. Hairdsley’s troubles,
told over for the hundredth time, I am sure.
She was a mild, inoffensive, weak-eyed old lady,
living with rather a sharp-tempered daughter-in-law.
Fan was out on an errand of mercy also.</p>

<p>“What a busy little woman you are!” he
said. “I am glad to see you at last; and I hope
no one will fall sick, or want broth, or be in
trouble for the next fifteen minutes. I suppose
clergymen’s houses are always houses of mercy.
I begin to feel conscience-smitten to think that
I am adding to the general burden. What will
you do with two boys?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot exactly tell,” I answered slowly, at
which he appeared a good deal amused, though
I did not see anything particularly funny in it.</p>

<p>“I think I would like to come myself, if I were
not going ‘over the seas.’ What would I be
good for? Could I do parish visiting?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and teach the Sunday school, and go
around with a subscription list, and—”</p>

<p>“O, the subscription list finishes me. I should
stop at every gate, and put down a certain
amount, and pay it out of my own pocket.
Begging I utterly abhor.”</p>

<p>“But if you had nothing in your pocket? If
your neighbors were richer than you, and if you
were trying to teach people that it was their
duty to provide for the sick and the needy?”</p>

<p>“Why, what a little preacher you are! Let
us go out in the moonlight. What a lovely
night! Suppose we walk down to meet your
father. He said he should not stay long.”</p>

<p>I could think of no good excuse to offer; so
we sauntered slowly through the little yard and
out to the street, both keeping silent for some
time.</p>

<p>“Miss Endicott,” he began presently, “I wish
I could interest you in my brothers. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
such a quaint, elder-sister air, that I know you
would have a good influence over them; though
they may not prove so very interesting,” he
went on, doubtfully. “Louis is nervous, and
has been ill; and boys are—well, different from
girls.”</p>

<p>I was not such a great ignoramus. I suppose
he thought, because we had a houseful of girls,
we knew nothing whatever of boys; so I answered,
warmly,—</p>

<p>“The parishioners sometimes come to tea with
two or three boys, who think they ought to
demolish the furniture as well as the supper.
Then there are the Sunday schools, and the
picnics, and the children’s festivals—”</p>

<p>“So you do see boys in abundance.”</p>

<p>“They are no great rarity,” I replied, drily.</p>

<p>“And you do not like them very much?”</p>

<p>“I do not exactly know.”</p>

<p>He laughed there. It vexed me, and I was
silent.</p>

<p>“I think it a mistake when the girls are put
in one family and the boys in another. Sisters
generally soften boys, tone them down, and give
them a tender grace.”</p>

<p>“And what are the brothers’ graces?” I
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Boys have numberless virtues, we must concede,”
he returned laughingly. “I think they
perfect your patience, broaden your ideas, and
add a general symmetry. They keep you from
getting too set in your ways.”</p>

<p>I saw him smile down into my face in the soft
moonlight, and it <em>did</em> annoy me. Men are
always thinking themselves so superior!</p>

<p>“Our mother died when Stuart was a baby.
She was always an invalid. But the summer I
spent with your mother is such a sunny little
oasis in my life, that I wanted the boys to have
at least one pleasant memory. I suppose I <em>am</em>
selfish—one of the strong points of the sex.”</p>

<p>“O,” I said, “I thought you were all virtues.”</p>

<p>“We have just about enough faults to preserve
ballast. But perhaps you do not like the
idea of their coming.”</p>

<p>He studied my face intently for a moment,
from my round chin up to my hair. I remembered,
in great confusion, that red-haired people
were suspected of being quick-tempered.</p>

<p>“I am sorry. They <em>will</em> be an annoyance. I
ought to have thought—”</p>

<p>“You misunderstood me, Mr. Duncan,” I began,
with a tremble in my voice. “I should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
have objected to their coming, even if I considered
that I had a right. It will ease papa’s
burdens in another way, and I am quite ready
to do my part.”</p>

<p>“Little girl, there are a good many things that
money cannot buy,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>I had surely done it now! How mercenary
he would think us! I could have cried with
vexation.</p>

<p>There was a silence of some minutes. I had
an inward consciousness that we were not foreordained
to get on nicely together.</p>

<p>“It is of some of these things that I would
like to speak,” he began, slowly. “The boys
have been to a good school, to be sure; but
they never have had a home, or home training.
And on some of the higher points of morals, a
woman’s influence does more by its silent grace
than hundreds of lectures. Will you be a little
patient with their rough ways and want of consideration?
I am offering you a part of my
burden, to be sure; but then, with your father’s
permission, I am to share part of yours. I am
to stand with you to-morrow at your little sister’s
christening. Believe me, that I am very
glad to be here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Papa had intended to ask Mr. Searle, his senior
warden. I was surprised at the change.</p>

<p>“Do you not like that, either?” and there
was a tinge of disappointment in his tone.</p>

<p>“Excuse me. It was only the suddenness.”</p>

<p>“I like the claim it gives me upon all your
remembrances. Then your interest need only last
a little while, if you so elect, while mine stretches
over a whole life.”</p>

<p>“There is papa!” I exclaimed, with a great
breath of relief, and sprang towards him. He
put his dear arm around me, and I felt as if my
perplexities had come to a sudden end.</p>

<p>On the porch we found Fanny and mamma,
and the conversation became very bright and
general. Indeed, we sat up past our usual hour.</p>

<p>When Fan and I were up stairs she began
at once.</p>

<p>“Mr. Duncan is just splendid! I envied you
your walk, and I came back so soon that I had
half a mind to run after you.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had been in my place. We did
not get on at all. I wonder if we shall like the
boys.”</p>

<p>“I shall not worry about them until they
come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“But a fortnight soon passes, and then good-by
to our quiet house.”</p>

<p>“A quiet house, with seven children in it!”
and Fan laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“Well they are not—”</p>

<p>“Boys! of course. But then, boys grow to
be men. And men like Stephen Duncan are
charming. One can afford to have a little
trouble.”</p>

<p>“O, Fan! how can you talk so?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t born blind or dumb. I cannot account
for it in any other way. Now, I dare
say, Miss Prim, you are thinking of the two
hundred dollars at the end of the summer, and
all that it is to buy.”</p>

<p>“It has to be earned first.”</p>

<p>“We will take Mrs. Green’s cheerful view of
boarders. ‘They are not much trouble in the
summer, when you only eat ’em and sleep
’em.’”</p>

<p>I could not help smiling at the quotation.</p>

<p>“I wish it were Stephen instead. And how
he talks of running over to England! Not making
as much of it as we should of going to New
York. It is just royal to be rich. Rose, I
think I shall marry for money, and set a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
example to the five girls coming after me; for,
my dear, I have a strong suspicion that you will
be an old maid.”</p>

<p>“O, Fanny, to-morrow will be Sunday, and
the baby’s christening.”</p>

<p>“Dear little Tot! yes. And we must set her
a pattern of sweetness, so that she may see the
manifest duty of all women. So, good-night,
Mother Hubbard of many troubles.”</p>

<p>Fan gave me two or three smothering kisses,
and subsided. I tried to do a little serious
thinking, but was too sleepy; and, in spite of
my efforts, I went off in a dream about her and
Mr. Duncan walking up the church aisle together,
Fan in a trailing white dress. I awoke
with the thought in my mind. But it <em>was</em> foolish,
and I tried to get it out.</p>

<p>Sunday was beautiful. The air was full of
fragrance; bloom of tree and shrub, pungent
odors of growing evergreens, and the freshening
breath of grassy fields. After a pleasant breakfast,
the children were made ready for church.
Sundays were always such enjoyable days with
us! I don’t know quite what the charm was;
but they seemed restful, and full of tender talking
and sweet singing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>After Sunday school, in the afternoon, the
children were catechized, and there was a short
service.</p>

<p>Very few knew of the baby’s christening; so
the congregation was not larger than usual.
After the lesson, we went forward, mamma,
Mrs. Whitcomb, baby, Mr. Duncan, and I. A
sweet solemn service it was, baby being very
good and quiet. Edith Duncan. The second
name had been agreed upon in the morning, at
Stephen’s request.</p>

<p>The children crowded around papa afterwards.</p>

<p>“I do not wonder that everybody loves him,”
Mr. Duncan said, as we walked homeward.
“And I feel as if I had a small claim upon
him myself. I am a sort of brother to you now,
Nelly.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” answered Nelly, with a roguish
laugh. “I did not think it was so near a relation
as that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may be a grandfather, then,” was
the grave reply.</p>

<p>“O, that’s splendid!” declared Tiny Tim,
who had big ears. “For we never had a grandfather,
you know, only—”</p>

<p>“Only what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“Your hair is not very white,” commented
Tim, as if suspicious of so near a relationship
with a young man.</p>

<p>He laughed gayly.</p>

<p>“I mean to be adopted into the family, nevertheless.
My hair may turn white some day.”</p>

<p>“There is no hurry,” returned Fanny. “I doubt
if Tim would be the more cordial on that account.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not;” with a shrewd smile. “But
you will have to give me a sort of elder brother’s
place.”</p>

<p>“Will you really be our brother?” asked
Daisy.</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to, if every one will
consent. Ask Miss Rose if I may.”</p>

<p>“You like him—don’t you, Rose?” Papa
said—</p>

<p>“We will take him for a brother,” I returned,
gaspingly, my cheeks scarlet, for fear of some
indiscreet revelation.</p>

<p>“I have never had any sisters; so I am very
glad to get you all. I hope you will treat me
well, and bring me home something nice when
you go abroad.”</p>

<p>“But we are not going,” said Tim; “and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
don’t believe I could hem a handkerchief nicely
enough for you.”</p>

<p>“Then it will have to be the other way. Let
me see: seven sisters. Well, I shall not forget
you while I am gone.”</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan went to church that evening
with Fan and Nelly, and, after he came home,
had a long talk with papa out on the porch.
Papa had enjoyed his guest very much and I
was glad of that. It had been quite a holiday
time.</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning, Mr. Duncan
went away. He took little Edith in his
arms, and walked up and down the room with
her.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I did not want to go away,” he
said, turning to mamma. “I think you must spoil
everybody in this house. I almost envy the
boys their summer vacation.—Ah, Miss Fanny,
you see I am by no means perfect.”</p>

<p>Fan nodded her head rather approvingly. I
am not sure but she liked a spice of wickedness.</p>

<p>“I shall remember your promise,” he said to
me, with his good-by.</p>

<p>What had I promised? About the boys—was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
it? Well I would do my best. I should
have done it without his asking.</p>

<p>“And in three months or so I shall see you
again. Good by, little flock.”</p>

<p>Ah, little did we guess then how many things
were to happen before we saw him again!</p>

<p>But the house seemed quite lonesome without
him. I made the children ready for school, and
then went at my rooms. If the boys <em>should</em> be
like Stephen, it would not be so very bad after
all.</p>

<p>There was a deal of work to be done in the
next fortnight. Our maid, as usual, was called
away, providentially, as Fan used to say of them
at any new disappearance, and we succeeded in
getting a middle-aged Irish woman, who could
wash and iron excellently, but who knew very
little about cooking. But mamma said there
was always something lacking; and, since she
was good and strong, it would do. All these
matters were barely settled, when a note came,
saying that Louis and Stuart Duncan would be
at the station on Friday at four.</p>

<p>Nelly walked over with papa. I had relented
a little, and made their apartment bright and
sweet with flowers. I had a fancy that I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
like Louis the better; he, being an invalid, was,
doubtless, gentle; and I wheeled the easy-chair
to a view of the most enchanting prospect out
of the south window. Then, as usual, I went
back to the work of getting supper. There is
always so much eating going on in this world,
and you need so many dishes to eat it off of!
We are not flowers of the field, or fairies, to
sup on dew.</p>

<p>“O, there they come—in a carriage!”</p>

<p>Tiny Tim clapped her hands at that, whereupon
the baby crowed and laughed.</p>

<p>A hack with two trunks. A bright, curly-haired
boy sprang out, and assisted Nelly in the
most approved style. Then papa, and a tall,
slender young man, looking old for his eighteen
years.</p>

<p>It did not seem a prepossessing face to me.
The lips were thin, the brow contracted with a
fretful expression, the nose undeniably haughty,
and the cheeks sunken and sallow. Stuart was
so different! red and white, with glittering chestnut
hair, and laughing eyes, that were hazel,
with a kind of yellowish tint in them, that gave
his whole face a sunny look. One warmed to
him immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Mamma went to the hall, and we followed;
and the introductions took place there.</p>

<p>“Take the trunks up to the room, Mat,” said
my father.</p>

<p>The boys bowed, and followed, Stuart casting
back a gay glance. Papa took off his hat, kissed
the baby, and sat down.</p>

<p>“I was quite shocked to see Louis,” he said,
in an anxious tone. “He looks very poorly indeed.
We must try our best to nurse him back
to health and strength. Rose, there is some
more work to do.”</p>

<p>The voices up stairs were raised quite high in
dispute. Louis gave a tantalizing laugh.</p>

<p>We never quarrelled. I do not know that we
were so much more amiable by nature; but our
disputes were of small importance, and never
reached any great height. So we all started
rather nervously.</p>

<p>“Boys!” said Fan, sententiously. “O, papa,
dearest, I am so glad that you came into the
world a full-grown, evenly-tempered man, and
that we all could not help being sweet if we
tried, seeing that we follow your example.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” returned papa, archly. “I hope
you do not use it all up, and that there is a
little left for the parish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“And the stranger within our gates.”</p>

<p>There seemed to be no cessation in the discussion
up stairs; so, presently, papa asked that
the bell might be rung. Stuart answered the
summons, coming down two steps at a bound,
and shaking the house.</p>

<p>“Louis begs you to excuse him,” he said,
with a graceful inclination. “He is knocked up
completely. He made such a muff of himself at
the examinations, that he has been cross as a
bear ever since. He has a lovely temper.”</p>

<p>There was a droll light in his eyes as he uttered
this.</p>

<p>“Your brother said he was in poor health.
So he—failed then?” and papa’s voice dropped
softly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Steve did not want him to try. He
said there was no hurry about his getting into
college. I only wish somebody would coddle
me up, and tell me that I needn’t study. I
think the whole world is in a conspiracy against
me.”</p>

<p>“You seem to thrive on it,” returned papa.</p>

<p>“O, there is no use of worrying one’s self
into the grave, so far as I can see. I believe
in enjoying everything that I can squeeze a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
of fun out of. So I laugh at Louis, and he
gets angry.”</p>

<p>“It is just possible that he may not see the
fun,” said papa, soberly.</p>

<p>“That is his lookout.”</p>

<p>“Is he really ill?” asked mamma.</p>

<p>“Not much, I guess. But he is as full of
whims as any old granny! He should have been
a girl.”</p>

<p>“Keep him on your side of the house,” retorted
Fan. “It is a good thing that boys do
not monopolize all the virtues.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with a peculiar stare, then
laughed. He did seem brimming over with merriment,
and rather pleased that Fanny had shown
her colors. So they had a little gay sparring.</p>

<p>“Do you not think your brother would like
a cup of tea?” asked mamma.</p>

<p>“When he gets in a fit like this, he generally
sulks it out,” returned Stuart carelessly, rising
and sauntering out on the porch.</p>

<p>Mamma could not resist, and presently went
up stairs, tapping lightly at the half-open door.</p>

<p>“I wish you would go away,” said a voice,
crossly.</p>

<p>“It is I,” exclaimed mamma, in her soft, yet
firm, tones, that always commanded respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“O! excuse me;” and Louis half raised his
head.</p>

<p>“Will you not have a cup of tea?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you;” rather ungraciously.</p>

<p>“Can I not do something for you? Does
your head ache?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I do not want anything but quiet.”</p>

<p>“Very well; you shall have that,” she said,
softly.</p>

<p>She came down stairs, with a little sigh.</p>

<p>“Is the bear still on exhibition, Mrs. Endicott?”
asked Stuart.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you, in your perfect health, do
not realize how hard some things are to endure,”
she said, with a touch of reproof in her voice.</p>

<p>“I am glad I have not such a fearful temper.—Miss
Endicott, you play croquet, of course. I
challenge you to a game.”</p>

<p>Fanny tripped gayly down the path. But
mamma, I noticed, looked very grave.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Fan</span>, Nelly, and Stuart played croquet until
it was fairly dusk. There were shouts
of laughter, and much hurrying around,
as if no time was to be lost. Mamma and I went
quietly about our duties; and when I had the
children in bed, I came into the nursery and
sat down to have a brief talk with her. By this
time the click of the balls had ceased, and the
three were strolling up and down the street.</p>

<p>“How odd it seems!” I said. “I wonder if
we shall get along nicely.”</p>

<p>“Don’t begin to fear thus early, Mr. Faint-heart,”
returned mamma, smilingly. “It will not
be as nice as having our house to ourselves;
but we are not doing it for pure enjoyment.
When we are tired, and worried, and discouraged
we must think of all the nice things we shall
buy in the fall, and be comforted. We shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
have papa a new study carpet, and get his chair
freshly covered.”</p>

<p>“And if it <em>could</em> be Russia leather! That
would last him all his life. At all events, we
will spend half on him; and I am sure he will
deserve it. He will, likely, be the greatest sufferer
by the confusion.”</p>

<p>“The boys will be out of doors much of the
time, no doubt. We must try to improve our
invalid as rapidly as possible. Poor boy!”</p>

<p>“Mamma,” I said, “what a great generous
heart you have! You always pity every one. I
have a suspicion that Mr. Louis is cross as well
as sick.”</p>

<p>“Then we must minister to the mind as well
as the body.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that Stuart is bright and cheerful.”</p>

<p>“O, those children must come in!” she said,
starting up. “Fanny is so thoughtless!”</p>

<p>They answered the summons, but sat down
on the porch step, where Stuart finished a story
of boyish school-pranks, which was very amusing,
to say the least. Papa came in time to hear the
last of it, and shook his head rather sagely.</p>

<p>“It is past ten,” announced mamma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Country bed-time!” said Stuart, gayly. “I
suppose, Mrs. Endicott, that is a hint for me to
go stir up my bear, and listen to a few growls.
A menagerie; ten cents admittance. Who’ll
venture in? Don’t all speak at once, or the
place may be crowded.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, since he is not very well, you had
better sleep in another room to-night,” mamma
said.</p>

<p>“Because he might eat me up in the night,
since he refused his supper. I am much obliged,
Mrs. Endicott.”</p>

<p>Mamma came around a trifle, so that she faced
him, and, standing in the shaded light, raised
her soft, dark eyes to his, and said,—</p>

<p>“This is out of consideration to him, and not
the fear of what will happen to you. That will
be the thought for you to go to bed with, and
see if you cannot resolve it into a lesson worth
the learning. If I adopt you into my household,
I shall train you as one of my children. And
you will be astonished to see what marvels a
little care for the feelings of others will work.”</p>

<p>Stuart blushed and smiled, said good night,
and followed papa to the best guest-chamber,
that I had put in such lovely order. And so
there was quiet through the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Louis did not make his appearance at breakfast;
but Stuart had been in stirring him up, for
we heard the growls. But he was so merry and
good-natured when he came down, that one had
not the heart to find any fault. Indeed, he kept
the children laughing all through the meal.</p>

<p>“What is there to do in this queer little town,
Mr. Endicott?” he asked presently. “Fishing,
I suppose—the staple amusement of lazy people.
Any hunting?”</p>

<p>“Not at this season; and very little at any.
There are some nice rambles, and the fishing, as
you say.”</p>

<p>“Any young fellows that one would like?”</p>

<p>“Yes a number; though some of them keep
pretty busy during the day. And I forgot rowing.
There are boats to be had.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I’ll take a saunter round. I
always do have the luck of finding some one.”</p>

<p>“And there are books in the library. You
may like to keep fresh for fall. So your brother
was a good deal disappointed at not passing?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It wouldn’t have troubled me. Steve
was not a bit anxious; so I should have let it
go without a sigh. There is nothing like resignation
in this world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“You are an admirable pattern of it,” said
Fanny. “I feel tempted to envy you. I have
another fortnight of school; and fearful examinations
are hanging over my devoted head.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I go in your stead? I am fresh
from it all, and might save you much vanity
and vexation of spirit.”</p>

<p>“Especially the vanity. Your kindness is only
exceeded by your great beauty. <em>Shakespeare.</em>”</p>

<p>“Fanny!” said papa.</p>

<p>Mamma rose from the table, and prepared a
dainty breakfast upon a waiter, pouring the coffee
in a pretty medallion cup that had been
given her at Christmas. Then she took it herself.
Stuart sprang up with an instinct of gentlemanliness.</p>

<p>“You are not going to carry that up stairs?”
he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“If you are not going to send a servant, I
will take it.”</p>

<p>“You may carry it for me, if you like; but I
wish to make a call upon your brother.”</p>

<p>He was her attendant as far as the door; but
when her summons was answered, she dismissed
him. Then she walked straight to the bedside,
placing her tray on a small table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Are you rested this morning?” she asked,
gently. “I think you will feel better for some
breakfast. I am sorry that you should be so
fatigued and ill, for a place seldom looks bright
under such circumstances. But we will do our
best for you, and you must try as well.”</p>

<p>The scowl remained in his forehead. He raised
himself on his elbow, and turned towards her,
though his eyes were still averted.</p>

<p>“I am obliged for the trouble, though I do
not need any breakfast,” he said, rather gruffly.</p>

<p>“I think you <em>do</em> need it. Here is a glass of
cool spring water, and some fragrant coffee. A
little of both may revive you. Does your head
still ache? If I had known just what to do for
you, I should have come again last night.”</p>

<p>“Was it you who—” and his face flushed a
swarthy scarlet.</p>

<p>“Yes;” and mamma looked steadily at him
out of her sweet brown eyes.</p>

<p>He moved uneasily, and in his heart wished
she were away.</p>

<p>“Was it you who came last evening?” he
asked, in a low, wondering tone.</p>

<p>“Yes. I felt anxious about you. I knew you
were in a strange place, and, doubtless, feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
awkward and lonesome. That must be my
apology.”</p>

<p>“O,” he exclaimed, “don’t make any—to me.
I acted like a boor! I am sorry and ashamed.
And I don’t deserve that you should take all
this trouble for me. But I had been—”</p>

<p>“And I <em>did</em> sympathize with you to the utmost.
The disappointment must have proved
great. But I do believe it will be much better
for you to wait. You were not strong enough
to take up a college course.”</p>

<p>“Yet I had said those things over and over
again. I knew them fairly well, at least. And
to have all those boobies set up and sneer! I
could have killed them!”</p>

<p>He looked so at the moment.</p>

<p>“O,” mamma said, “you must not think of
this now. Do not try to keep the angry flames
alive. It is a bright, lovely morning; and if
you could make the effort to come down on the
porch, you would feel so much better! Try this
coffee—to please me.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind and solicitous.”</p>

<p>There was a little tremble in his voice; but
he made no effort to touch the food.</p>

<p>“If you appreciate it, you will begin your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
breakfast before everything gets cold. You will
feel more like rising then. Come, I mean to
cheer you up in spite of yourself. This is not
Doubting Castle, and I cannot take in Giant
Despair.”</p>

<p>He smiled faintly then, and sipped his coffee.</p>

<p>“There,” mamma said, in her bright, cheery
way, “you have made a small beginning, and
that gives me faith in you. Now I must go
back to my flock. Down stairs there is a cool,
pleasant library, and a piano, which always stands
open. I want you to feel at home.”</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> good,” he returned. “Can I have
the library to myself, or only with Mr. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“Yes; or the parlor, either. Indeed, Mr. Endicott
has finished his sermons, and will be out
nearly all day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Stuart was lying in wait at the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Well,” with a gay little laugh, “did you
beard the lion in his den? I must go up and
make him roar.”</p>

<p>“No,” said mamma, laying her hand on his
arm, “you must not go up; and I ask, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
personal favor, that you will not tease him this
whole day.”</p>

<p>“Tease him! The baby! Poor little thing!”</p>

<p>“I have promised him a quiet morning. You
will not compel me to break my word?”</p>

<p>“Then I shall have to go out and hunt up
some fun.”</p>

<p>She smiled in her irresistible fashion, that
conquered if it did not convince.</p>

<p>We had made an exception, and done the most
of our Saturday’s work on Friday morning.
So now there was only a little dusting, with
the usual making of beds, and all that. I had
just finished the other rooms, when Louis left
his, and went quietly down to the study, shutting
himself in. To mamma’s satisfaction, he
had eaten nearly all the breakfast she had prepared.</p>

<p>I put the room in its usual order. Oddly
enough, I found a withered rose under the pillow,
and it was still sweet. I remembered that
Stephen was very fond of roses. There were
ever so many small articles strewn about. I
thought those big boys were as careless as the
children.</p>

<p>Papa came in just before dinner was ready,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
and had a little chat with Louis, though the
young man was not disposed to be social. At
dinner he seemed dreadfully awkward and embarrassed,
his sallow cheeks, flushing at the least
word. Somehow I was glad Stuart was not
there. Afterwards he went up to his room, and
spent the whole afternoon alone.</p>

<p>We had rather a funny time. Stuart came in
late, and insisted upon having his dinner in the
kitchen, telling Ann two or three such laughable
Irish stories, that they were friends straightway.
Then he would insist upon carrying Fan’s basket
when she was ready to start on her visitation,
as she called it.</p>

<p>“It was as good as a play,” he said afterwards.
“I thought I should smile audibly at
that old lady—Mrs. Means, I believe you called
her. She is an ungrateful wretch, Mrs. Endicott.
‘She did not like such light, chaffy bread;
it had no heart. You might as well eat sawdust.’
And she wanted to know how many eggs were in
the custard; and when people sent currants, she
wished they would send sugar, too. ‘Nasty, sour
things!’ Why, I had half a mind to hustle the
gifts back in the basket, and bring them home.”</p>

<p>“We are not to get weary in well doing,” said
mamma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not sure but a little wholesome hunger
would be good. And then that old Mrs.
Bogert! Doesn’t she look funny there in the bed,
with her little, wrinkled face and that flapping
cap-ruffle. And her talk, and the queer way in
which she keeps questioning her maid—‘Betty,
how long is it since I was tuck sick?’ in that
high, cracked voice, which sounds like a smashed
hand organ with a monkey grinding it. ‘Betty,
tell the gentleman how I fell down the cellar
stairs. Betty, bring me my snuff-box; mebby
the young gentleman will take a pinch.’”</p>

<p>He imitated Mrs. Bogert’s tone so exactly,
that we could not help laughing.</p>

<p>“Did you take a pinch?” asked Nelly.</p>

<p>“Of course I did. And such sneezing!”</p>

<p>“It was dreadful,” said Fan, with a reproachful
look. “And not a bit in earnest.”</p>

<p>“How <em>did</em> you do it?” Nelly questioned.</p>

<p>“This way.”</p>

<p>There isn’t any method of spelling such terrific
sneezing. No combination of letters would do
it justice. I thought I wouldn’t laugh; but I
did and the children screamed.</p>

<p>“Good snuff—wasn’t it?” he said, with a
droll wink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can do it, all in fun,”
said wide-eyed Daisy.</p>

<p>“I do not believe I shall take you out with me
again,” commented Fan, severely.</p>

<p>“But I know the way now. I shall drop in
to see the old lady often, and get a pinch of
snuff. O, dear! I am almost worn out with my
arduous duties. Can any one stay me with a
glass, and comfort me with cold water—the
literal for apples and love? And then can’t
we dissipate on croquet? If I sit still much
longer I shall have the rickets. My physician
prescribed active exercise.”</p>

<p>“You had better take the baby out in her
carriage, if you want exercise,” said Tiny Tim,
having heard the two connected some way.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“For—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Satan finds some mischief still</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For idle hands to do.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Isn’t that in the hymn book?”</p>

<p>“Not in mine,” returned Fan.</p>

<p>“Well, I am sure it is in the spelling-book.
I learned it somewhere; and it is about a busy
bee. Good instructions, like pins, are never
lost.”</p>

<p>“But pins <em>are</em> lost. Your logic is faulty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“No they’re always gone before—that is, before
you want them.”</p>

<p>“You are too smart for your size,” said Fan.
“I am afraid you’ll grow up a dunce.”</p>

<p>“Well, you cannot have all the virtues for a
little money. As it is, I think of striking for
higher wages.”</p>

<p>“You are not worth what you get now,” said
Fan, running away.</p>

<p>Stuart did not venture up stairs until just before
supper. Louis declined to come down; so
mamma sent him some tea, berries, and biscuits.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are beginning in a way to
make trouble for yourself,” papa said, thoughtfully,
afterwards.</p>

<p>“I am going to indulge him for a few days.
He is nervous, and really bashful; and I want
him to learn to like us. But he cannot be
forced to do anything.”</p>

<p>“I believe I like my girls the best,” said
papa, fondly.</p>

<p>Saturday evenings, when no one dropped in,
were our choicest time of all the week. Mamma
played, and we all sang. This time no one
came to disturb us. And we never knew, until
long afterwards, that Louis Duncan listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
with his eyes full of tears, and had not the
courage to join us. But it always appeared to me
like a little bit of heaven below. Papa’s sweet
tenor voice seemed to belong to some particular
hymns, and it took me far above the petty work-day
affairs. How good and lovely he was in
his every-day walks and ways!</p>

<p>Louis began to get somewhat acquainted with
us on Sunday. He did not go to church, but
lay on the bed reading nearly all day. No one
found any fault with him; and Stuart’s teasing
tongue was hushed. I think he stood a little in
awe of my mother, gentle as she was. It was
plain to see that the boys had been brought up
with mere outward forms of religion; that they
had no love and very little respect for it. How
different they were from Stephen!</p>

<p>But the enforced quiet was broken on Monday
morning, there were some high words, and
then an unmistakable blow, followed by a struggle
and a fall. Papa went up stairs.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, with severe but simple
dignity, “are you brothers, and must you quarrel?
If you have no respect for yourselves, I
implore you to have a little for my house, that
has hitherto been the abode of harmony. I will
not have it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>The combatants paused, and glared at each
other with angry eyes. Stuart had come off
victor, for it was Louis who had fallen. He
was deadly white now, with a blue line about
the mouth.</p>

<p>“I won’t be struck as if I was a child,” exclaimed
Stuart, with fierce determination; “and
he struck me.”</p>

<p>“I told you to let that brush alone,” said the
other, sullenly. “Your own was there.”</p>

<p>“Stuart, go in the room opposite and finish
your toilet. I shall expect an apology from you
both when you come down stairs. Breakfast is
ready.”</p>

<p>It seemed as if we were to have neither of
them; but when the meal was about half over
Stuart entered the room. His face was flushed,
and his eyes were still sending out fiery rays;
but he went straight to papa.</p>

<p>“Mr. Endicott,” he said, making an effort to
steady his voice, “I am truly sorry that I should
have been so rude and ungentlemanly in your
house. I ask your pardon.—And yours, Mrs.
Endicott.”</p>

<p>“I pardon you on condition that a similar
event never happens, while you are here, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
least. You are both too old to fall into such
rough-and-tumble school-boy fights.”</p>

<p>Mamma held out her hand to him as he
passed her. He blushed deeply, but seized it
with a thankful eagerness. After that our meal
was very silent.</p>

<p>Ann went up stairs to see if Louis would
have any breakfast.</p>

<p>“Sure, he’s crosser than two sticks when the
fire is kindlin’. He doesn’t want sup nor bite;
and if he did, it’s little he’d get from me.”</p>

<p>So mamma judged that it was best to pay no
further attention to him. He did not even come
down at noon; and then Stuart found that his
door was locked.</p>

<p>Quite late in the afternoon I was hurrying
through the hall, when he opened his door suddenly.
His hair was tumbled, his cheeks scarlet,
and his eyes wild and staring.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, get me a drink of water!”
he cried, hoarsely.</p>

<p>I took it up to him, and knocked; but there
was no answer. I made some ado opening the
door, and walked in rather timidly. He was
laughing and talking incoherently but clutched
at the pitcher of water and drank great, desperate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
swallows. Then he sank back on the bed
exhausted.</p>

<p>I ran to mamma in affright.</p>

<p>“Louis Duncan is sick and out of his mind!”
I cried. “O, mamma, I am sorry they came.
We shall have our hands full of trouble.”</p>

<p>She went to the room with me. He did not
appear to know either of us, and we could not
rouse him to any coherency.</p>

<p>“It is a fever. The doctor must be sent for
immediately. Tell Nelly to go. And, Rose, we
must arrange the other room, and take him over
there, since it may be a long illness. Well, we
must have patience. God knows what is for the
best.”</p>

<p>I soon had everything in order. Papa coming
in, he partly led and partly carried Louis to the
best room. Mamma bathed his head and put
some draughts on his wrists and his feet. Now
he lay quietly, with his eyes half open, breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>Dr. Hawley called just before supper.</p>

<p>“A bad case,” he said, gravely, “a bad case!
Why, the fellow is worn to skin and bone already,
and looks as if he had had the jaundice
for the last month. But we will do our best.
He may be stronger than he appears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Stuart felt pretty sober that evening.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought not to have stirred him
up so this morning,” he said. “But it is such
fun! And it was all about a trifle. I used his
hair-brush; and he is as particular as any old
maid. Then I tormented him a little, and he
seized the brush and gave me a box on the ear,
which I won’t take from any one without a
row. I am not a baby. And it was awful
mean of him! And so we clinched. But he
has been in a dreadful temper for the last month.
He was mad because Stephen wouldn’t let him
go to Lake George with a lot of fellows.”</p>

<p>“It was fortunate that he did not,” returned
mamma. “And, Stuart, I hope, in the weeks
to come, you will learn your duty towards him.
God has not given you this tie for you to disregard
so utterly.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked at her with wondering eyes,
but made no answer.</p>

<p>“Our first experience with boys seems to be
rather trying,” said Fanny, as we were going to
bed that night. “I hope and pray that he may
not die—and in our house!”</p>

<p>I thought of what Stephen had asked of me.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">An</span> awesome quiet settled over the house.
I did not remember a time when any
one had ever been very sick. The children
gathered in groups, and spoke in whispers, and
for a day or two Stuart appeared almost conscience-stricken.
But his natural flow of spirits
could not be repressed. Yet his laugh jarred
on my nerves. We were used to caring so
much for each other’s welfare and comfort, and
sympathizing with sorrows or trivial illnesses, that
his carelessness seemed to us as something quite
dreadful. Yet he was so pleasant and good-natured,
so ready to do anything that was asked
of him, though he never appeared to think that
he might volunteer any little service.</p>

<p>“We must make some allowance for them,”
mamma said, in her kindly fashion. “Remember
that they have had no mother. Much of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
lives has been spent at school; and their uncle
was a cold and rather arrogant man, papa
thinks. So they have had no chance to acquire
the graces of home life.”</p>

<p>When the tidings became noised abroad
through the village, we were quite besieged.
Mamma threw up the fortifications at the hall
door. The old women, who were curious, or
anxious, or even kindly-hearted in their officious
way, heard all of the story there, or in the sitting-room,
that it was necessary for them to
know. Aunt Letty Perkins was not last nor
least.</p>

<p>“Was it true, as she had understood, that
these two young men came to study with Mr.
Endicott? She heard they were going in college,
or something or other. She hoped he would
get well paid for his trouble—young college
chaps were always pretty wild. There was no
great loss without some small gain; and if this
young fellow was sick, he couldn’t be kitin’
round the village into all sorts of mischief.”</p>

<p>“No, to be sure not,” returned mamma, with
a smile at this sort of comfort.</p>

<p>“But what <em>are</em> you to do? You have your
hands full already, with such a houseful of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
children! I allers say that Mis’ Endicott’s the
most wonderful woman I know. I should think
you’d a been worn out long ago; and here you
haven’t scarcely a wrinkle in your face!”</p>

<p>“I do not know why people should wrinkle
up their faces when they have a number of
healthy, happy children about them. Why, they
keep you young, Mrs. Perkins. It takes you
back to your own childhood continually.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’re a going to get paid for all
this.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe the Duncans will become
chargeable to the parish, since they have fortunes
of their own,” said mamma, rather dryly.</p>

<p>“Rich, now? Well, that’s good! Though
rich men’s sons are exposed to sights of temptations.
No one knows!” and Aunt Letty shook
her head solemnly.</p>

<p>“I fancy there will not be many here at
Wachusett.”</p>

<p>“Mean to keep them the whole year?”</p>

<p>“No; only through vacation.”</p>

<p>“They have gardeens, I s’pose?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Endicott is their sole guardian now,
with the exception of an elder brother, who acts
for them.”</p>

<p>“O!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Then Aunt Letty fidgeted about.</p>

<p>“If you should want some one to help do
the nussin’, I could take my knitting and sit
up stairs. I haven’t much of anything to do,
and I’d as lief.”</p>

<p>“No,” said mamma. “I am much obliged.
Mrs. Whitcomb is coming over this evening.”</p>

<p>So Aunt Letty had to go away without seeing
the patient. But she had considerable news
to sow broadcast, which comforted her.</p>

<p>For the first two days I spent all my time in
the sick room, while papa remained at night.
The violent paroxysms were not very long at a
time, and for the rest he only tumbled about
and wanted a drink every few moments. Then
Mrs. Whitcomb arrived, and I was partly released.</p>

<p>By Saturday Dr. Hawley had nearly given
up the faintest hope. Every one knew who
was meant when the prayer for the sick was
used on Sunday. Something in papa’s voice
touched me in a peculiar manner. In the great
calm of earth and sky, it seemed so strange that
any life should go out into utter nothingness!
Why, the smallest insects were on the wing,
and birds and bees went humming and soaring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
with no anxious cares, just brim full of glad,
free life.</p>

<p>If we had been less engrossed, we should
have felt quite elated over Fanny’s successful
examination; but, as it was, we were glad to
have her at home, without thinking much about
it. So the days passed until the quivering life
seemed to hang by a mere thread.</p>

<p>“If he can go through the next twelve
hours!” said Dr. Hawley, in a low tone. “But
there seems so little strength to him. I can’t
realize that he has ever been such a rosy, rollicking
boy as that Stuart; and yet I do not
see why he should not have been. Well, we
have done our best, Mrs. Whitcomb, and the
good parson has prayed; so we must leave all
the rest in God’s hands. Don’t let him sleep
more than an hour at a time, and then give
him a teaspoonful of this, out of the glass—remember.”</p>

<p>I didn’t want to go to bed. I crept up to
the room, and Mrs. Whitcomb, and the other
strange, uncertain presence, standing by the
window and watching the great stars and the
little flecks of silver cloud threading their way
in and out like dainty ladies. I was so afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of death, too! and yet I wanted to stay. I thought
of Stephen’s perplexity concerning his brothers,
and did not wonder at it now. I was sorry
that I had been so ungracious that night; but
I had made all the amends I could. And I
prayed softly for the sick boy, that he might
live to a better and less selfish life, that he
might see and know the great things there are
for men to do in the world.</p>

<p>Twelve. The old eight-day clock in the hall
told it off in a solemn way, and went on ticking
“forever, never,” and Mrs. Whitcomb breathed
in her chair as if she were asleep; but in a
moment she rose and gave the medicine.</p>

<p>“You had better lie down here on the couch,
Rose. Here is a pillow.”</p>

<p>“No; I am not sleepy.” And crossing my
arms on the window sill, I rested my chin on
them, and watched the stars again.</p>

<p>One, two, three; and the summer night began
to show signs of drowsiness. The stars
grew dimmer, and there was a peculiar grayish
duskiness in the heavens. Then a faint stirring in
the east, a melting of the gray into rose and gold,
a piping of birds in the leafy trees, and a
strange tremulousness in all the air. I turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
away from the window and glanced at the pallid
face, put my fingers on the thin wrist. Had
the resurrection of the morning reached him?</p>

<p>“O, Mrs. Whitcomb,” I exclaimed, “his pulse
is stronger! I believe he will live. I am so
thankful!”</p>

<p>“Now run to bed, dear. You have had your
way, and sat up all night.”</p>

<p>I did fall asleep, and never woke until the
breakfast bell rang. Dr. Hawley came in bright
and early, and the verdict was favorable.</p>

<p>“Now you must feed him on beef tea, and
I’ll feed him on iron,” he said to Mrs. Whitcomb.
“We will run a race to see which can
get the most fat on his bones. Goodness knows
there’s need enough of it. He seems to have
put into practice some one’s suggestion, to take
off his flesh and sit in his bones a space. Cool,
for this hot weather.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we can venture to be a little jolly
now,” Stuart said, that afternoon, as we were
all on the porch. “We have been going about
this whole week like a funeral procession.”</p>

<p>“There might have been one—very easily,”
I replied, with as much sternness as I could
put in my voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“But when you are through the woods, what
is the use of frightening yourself with the darkness
and the ‘bug-a-boos’? Isn’t that what you
tell children? I never really believed that he
was going to die. It is only your good people—”</p>

<p>“Then there is not much fear of you,” said
Fan.</p>

<p>“Thank Goodness, no. I mean to have a
deal of fun out of life yet. Just wait until I
can get my hands into the money. There will
be larks then, I can tell you. Meanwhile, may
we not dissipate harmlessly on croquet?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” was my answer. “Your brother
is very weak and nervous; and I have sometimes
found the click of the balls hard to bear
myself.”</p>

<p>“Hang it! I wish he was in—England with
Stephen. He is always putting on airs of some
kind. Before I’d be such a Molly-fuss-budget
I’d go off and hang myself, and leave my money
to the nearest of kin.”</p>

<p>“O, Stuart,” I exclaimed, “you are perfectly—”</p>

<p>“There, don’t preach to me, you small midget!
I hate girls’ preaching. It’s hard enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
have it on Sundays. Can a leopard change his
spots? Yes, he can go off to another spot. So
I’ll go. Adieu, little grandmother.”</p>

<p>He caught his hat, and walked down the garden
path as if whistling for a wager.</p>

<p>“There, you have made him angry,” declared
Fan.</p>

<p>“I cannot help it. He doesn’t seem to care
for anything. O!”</p>

<p>I was after him in a minute, for there he had
Tabby by the nape of the neck, holding her up
high to see her draw up her feet and curl her
tail between her legs like a dog.</p>

<p>“Put her down!” I cried, authoritatively.</p>

<p>He held me off with one arm.</p>

<p>“Why, she likes it,” he said. “Look! what
an angelic smile illumines her countenance!”</p>

<p>“Mia-o-o-ow!” was kitty’s answer, in a prolonged
wail; but she managed to twist herself
out of his grasp, and bounded off.</p>

<p>“You are a cruel, hateful boy!” I exclaimed,
angrily.</p>

<p>But he only laughed, and went on his way
whistling. Fan glanced up from her embroidery.</p>

<p>“It is tit for tat,” she said, laughingly;
“preaching and practice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>I was quiet for some minutes.</p>

<p>“Do I preach much, Fan?” I asked, rather
soberly.</p>

<p>“Not very much. But it may be as dangerous
a habit as scolding, if one gets confirmed in
it. And I suppose it isn’t entertaining to boys.”</p>

<p>“But what are you to do when they are just
as bad as they can be?”</p>

<p>“Bear it with Christian fortitude and resignation.
I am not sure but it will be good for us
to have something that takes us out of the one
groove, and shows us that the world is wider
than the little space just around us.”</p>

<p>There was much truth in that, to be sure.</p>

<p>“You see we have had everything pretty much
one way; and now we have come to a change
in the current. I rather like the stir and freshening
up.”</p>

<p>“But if Tabby was yours—”</p>

<p>“You remember the old lady whose idea of
heaven was to ‘sit in a clean checked apron,
and sing psalms;’ and I think yours must be to
sit here on the porch, in a clean white dress,
and nurse that sleek Maltese cat.”</p>

<p>“O, Fan, how can you be so irreverent?”</p>

<p>I heard the faint tinkle of a bell; so I ran
up stairs. Mrs. Whitcomb asked me to sit there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
while she went out for a walk. I took up
some crocheting, and, as I worked, watched the
wind blowing about the high tree-tops, and
making picturesque backgrounds of the blue
sky. Then a wood robin came and sang his
sweet song almost in my ear.</p>

<p>The sick youth stirred and opened his eyes
wide. How strange and sunken they looked!</p>

<p>“Where am I?”</p>

<p>I started at the question, and collected my
wandering senses.</p>

<p>“At the rectory. At Mr. Endicott’s.”</p>

<p>“O! Have I been sick? How long since—I
can’t seem to remember—”</p>

<p>“It is almost a fortnight since you were taken
ill. But you are out of all danger, and have
only to get well.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I have been a great deal of
trouble. Did I talk much?” And he glanced
sharply at me.</p>

<p>“No; that is, it was not of much account.”</p>

<p>“Where is Stuart?”</p>

<p>“Out somewhere.”</p>

<p>“May I have a drink?”</p>

<p>I gave him that.</p>

<p>“And you have been taking care of me—all
the time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Not all. Mamma and Mrs. Whitcomb have
done the most of it.”</p>

<p>“Was I near dying?”</p>

<p>“We thought so, at one time,” I answered,
rather slowly, not feeling quite sure that the
admission was right.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have been much loss. Both
Stephen and Stuart would have been glad, no
doubt, or, at least, relieved. Don’t look so
horror-stricken.”</p>

<p>“I think you are unjust to both your brothers,”
I said. “But perhaps it is best not to
talk any more. You are still weak.”</p>

<p>He turned his face over on the pillow, and
was silent until mamma came in and spoke in
her cheerful fashion.</p>

<p>“You have all been very kind, much kinder
than I deserve. How long will it take me to
get well?”</p>

<p>“That depends a good deal upon yourself,”
returned mamma. “When you feel like it, you
may begin to sit up. And you must keep as
cheerful as possible. Are you not hungry?”</p>

<p>He thought he was presently; but he made a
wry face over the beef tea.</p>

<p>“Can’t I have something besides this?” he
asked. “I am so tired of it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“Then you may take it hereafter as medicine,
and we will find a new article of diet. I am
glad that you are sufficiently improved to desire
a change. I will see what I can find for you.”</p>

<p>She was as good as her word; and Mrs. Whitcomb
brought him up the cunningest tea in the
old-fashioned china, and a fresh nosegay of spice
pinks lying beside his plate.</p>

<p>“O, how delightful they are! I am very
much obliged,” he said, gratefully.</p>

<p>That evening Kate Fairlie and her brother Dick
came over to call upon us.</p>

<p>“I heard your invalid was out of danger, or
I should not have ventured,” she began, after
the first greetings were over, “for it is not a
call of condolence merely. Fan, aren’t you glad
school is over? But what can you find to
occupy yourself with? I am actually bored to
death already. We are to have some company
from the city next week, and we want to get
up a picnic to go to Longmeadow. Won’t you
two girls join, and the young Mr. Duncan who
isn’t sick? Dick thinks him such a funny fellow.
Where is he? Can’t I have an introduction?
The boys all seem to know him very
well. And is it true that they are so rich?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“They are very well provided for,” said Fan,
quietly.</p>

<p>“And was that handsome man who came to
church with you one Sunday, not long ago, their
brother? Has he gone to make the grand tour
of Europe? O, how I <em>do</em> envy people who can
go abroad!”</p>

<p>“He has gone to England on some business.
He has been to Europe before.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he charming? How I should have
enjoyed such a visitor! Mother says that father
might give us a winter in Paris just as well as
not. It would perfect my French so much!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to teach?” asked Fan.</p>

<p>She had such a droll way of clipping the
wings of Kate’s higher flights.</p>

<p>“Well, I should think not, Fanny Endicott!
But I want to be fitted for elegant society. I
shall go to Washington a while in the winter;
that I am sure of, for my aunt has invited me;
and she has no children—so she will be glad
to have me. And so I mean to make a brilliant
marriage.”</p>

<p>“That’s all girls think about,” growled Dick.</p>

<p>“O, no,” returned Fan; “some have to think
about darning stockings, and making pies, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
altering over their last summer’s dresses. And
some of them think about the future, whether
they will be teacher or dress-maker, or step
over to the strong-minded side and keep books
or lecture.”</p>

<p>“I hope neither of you two girls will be
strong-minded,” exclaimed Dick. “Your father
does not believe in it at all; and it doesn’t
seem the thing for women to be running round
the country lecturing and haggling with men
about money.”</p>

<p>“But, Dick, they have to haggle with the
butcher, and baker, and candlestick-maker, and
dry-goods clerk. And they have to scrub floors
and go out washing, and all that. I am afraid
I <em>would</em> rather be Anna Dickinson, even if it
is heterodox.”</p>

<p>“And have people laughing about you,” put
in Kate, loftily.</p>

<p>“They do not laugh very much when you are
a success, I have observed,” was Fan’s reply.</p>

<br>

<p>“O, don’t let us bother about this humbug.
We want to talk over the picnic. Annie and
Chris Fellows are going, and the Hydes, and the
Wests, and the Elsdens. In fact only the nicest
people have been asked. We want it to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>select. I should have come to you right in the
first of it but for the sickness. Mrs. Hyde and
Mrs. West are going to take charge of the
party. We will have croquet and games, and a
little dancing. Longmeadow is such a lovely
place! You must go.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to see what mamma says
about it,” I made answer, “and if we can be
spared.”</p>

<p>“Why, there is Nelly and all the others to
help take care of the baby. I am glad we never
had any babies to bother with. I should feel
dreadfully if I had a sister. Mamma wouldn’t
care half so much for me.”</p>

<p>“Mother-love goes around a good ways,” I
said, a trifle resentfully.</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t believe there is another woman
in all Wachusett who loves her girls any better
than your mother,” spoke up Dick, who always
had been mamma’s great admirer. “And on the
whole, I don’t know any girls who have a better
time at home.”</p>

<p>“I believe Dick would like our mamma to
open a foundling hospital,” said Kate, with a
sneer. “As it is, he keeps the barn full of dogs
and cats, for we will not have them in the
house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>Stuart came up the walk, and Fan called him.
He was tall and well-grown for his sixteen years,
and Kate was delighted with him. He accepted
her invitation at once but we were not prepared
to give a positive answer.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hyde came over the next morning
and explained it to mamma. It was to be very
select; that is, only rich people were to be invited.
We stood on the boundary line. As daughters
of a clergyman we could visit the poor without
contamination, and the wealthier people were
not expected to pass us by. So we had the
best of both. But Fan declared that it was
sometimes hard work getting squeezed into all
sorts of places, whether you fitted or not.</p>

<p>“But the great business of this life is to
make yourself fit,” papa always declared.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“One</span> of us must certainly go to the
picnic,” papa said; and he did not
see why both could not go.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Whitcomb will have to leave us to-morrow,”
mamma rejoined. “I do not believe I
could spare you both. On the other hand, we
do not desire to slight Mrs. Hyde’s kind invitation.”</p>

<p>“Let Fannie go then,” I exclaimed; “she
and Stuart get along so nicely!”</p>

<p>“I am always ready,” said Fan. “But, at the
same time, I do not feel as if I ought, in every
case, to have the first choice and all the pleasures.
I am willing to take my turn in staying
at home.”</p>

<p>“But I would rather.”</p>

<p>“And Rose is used to the nursing now.”</p>

<p>“I thought Mrs. Whitcomb was going to help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
us sew,” said Fan. “No one, save the baby,
has anything to wear.”</p>

<p>“She has been so confined to the sick room,
my dear! And Mr. Sprague sent word that he
should come for her to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“When I get rich, I shall hire Mrs. Whitcomb
by the year,” Fan announced. “She shall
sew, and knit, and tend babies, and turn old
dresses; and we will have a perpetual holiday.”</p>

<p>Mamma laughed at that.</p>

<p>“It is very nice to have invitations to select
picnics,” Fanny began when we were up stairs.
“But, since we are <em>not</em> lilies of the field, it behooves
us to ask, wherewith shall we be clothed?
Nelly will have to take most of my last summer’s
gowns. That sounds rather grand—doesn’t
it? The wood-colored lawn I inherited from
mamma, my tucked nainsook, and my pique.
I can’t begin to squeeze into the waists; and tight-lacing
is injurious, even if you should pursue it
from the noble motive of economy. I don’t want
to wear my new poplin and get it spoiled; and my
cambric is faded. I am dying for a new white
dress. O, dear, What a houseful there is to
provide for, to be sure!”</p>

<p>“You do need the dress sadly. I wonder if
we couldn’t get it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“We might ask papa for the collection
money.”</p>

<p>“O, Fan, you irreverent girl!”</p>

<p>“Well, I am sure that is our only mode of
living. It is a good one, but rather limited at
times. But won’t there be a jolly rejoicing in the
fall! Suppose we should have a new dress all
round at the same instant! Would it ruin the
parish?”</p>

<p>“Not if we earned it ourselves, surely.”</p>

<p>“As we shall—keeping a hotel.” And she
laughed.</p>

<p>Mamma favored the new dress. Fan went
down to the store that afternoon and bought it,
and Dick Fairlie insisted upon driving her home
in the phaeton, telling her again and again how
glad he was that she would go to the picnic.</p>

<p>“Why, there would be no lack of girls, Dick,”
she said, gayly.</p>

<p>“But they are not like you.”</p>

<p>“And Wachusett would be very stupid and
monotonous if all its girls were alike, or all its
mountains.”</p>

<p>“But I can talk to you; and some of them I
can not get on with at all. I don’t like smart
women.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“O, Dick! I always supposed you liked me
on account of my smartness. If I had one virtue
above another, I thought it was that.”</p>

<p>Dick blushed to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>“I did not mean just that, Miss Fanny,” he
stammered. “But some of the academy girls
have a way of laughing if you are not on your
best behavior every moment. And I am a plain,
old-fashioned fellow. I like Scotch ballads ever
so much better than opera music, that I can’t
understand a word of; but I do believe Kate
would think it a disgrace to sing in anything
but Italian. And woods and trees, and rambles
through them, and talks with friends, seem like
ballad-singing to me.”</p>

<p>“Now, Dick, that is a nice, pretty idea. You
see you do have thoughts quite like other
people. And the ballad-singing is delightful. I
like it myself.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would keep on down to the pines,”
said, Dick wistfully. “It is just a pleasant
drive. I have to go for Kate at six; and here
I have an hour on my hands.”</p>

<p>“I cannot to-day, though I’m much obliged,
Dick,” with a pause and a questioning glance.</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“I would like to ask a favor.”</p>

<p>“Anything. I’d be glad to do it for you.”</p>

<p>“Jennie Ryder is just getting over her fever,
you know. I was down there yesterday, and
she was wishing I owned a carriage—which I
never shall. But if you could, and <em>would</em>, take
her out, it would give me as much pleasure as
going myself.”</p>

<p>“I will,” returned Dick, with alacrity.</p>

<p>Fan told mamma and me.</p>

<p>“Though I suppose Kate would fancy her
phaeton contaminated, if she knew it,” Fan added,
with a laugh. “But Dick is bright enough
not to say much about it; and I hope Jennie
will have a splendid ride. She is just as nice
as anybody, even if she does sew for a living.
And I wish Dick would take a good honest
liking to her.”</p>

<p>“Fan!” said mamma, gravely.</p>

<p>“Which means that I am too young, or too
something else, to be thinking of love matters.
But they <em>do</em> interest me, mamma <em>mia</em>, and I
have a longing to add this one and that one
together, and have a sum total of happiness.
And then, little mother, you were only seventeen
yourself when you promised to love, honor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
&amp;c., as Mrs. Brown says; and I shall be seventeen
myself at Christmas. And think what an
ancient spinster Rose is getting to be!”</p>

<p>Mamma smiled a little, and examined her
dress.</p>

<p>“It was thirty-five cents a yard. They had
a lovely one for fifty; and I looked at it until
the flesh began to grow weak; then I fortified
myself by counting my money. And now comes
the tug of war to get it made.”</p>

<p>“We will all help a little,” returned mamma.</p>

<p>There was a general outcry the next morning
when Mrs. Whitcomb went away. Everybody
besieged her to set a day for her return.</p>

<p>“I’ll save out a fortnight for you in September,
if I possibly can,” she said, with her
sweetest smile. “I hope no one will be sick
then, and we will have a good, old-fashioned
visiting time. Take the best care you can of
my patient, Rose.”</p>

<p>I gathered some fresh flowers and carried
them up first of all. Louis nodded his head in
thanks.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry Mrs. Whitcomb had to go!”
I said, by way of making conversation.</p>

<p>“I liked her so much! Do you know—whether
any one has written to Stephen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Papa did. He waited until you were out of
danger, since he could not send for him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he would not have cared much
either way;” and the thin lip curled.</p>

<p>“Pardon me. I think he has a great deal of
love for you. He was so considerate of your
comfort and health when he was here!”</p>

<p>“Seemed to be, you mean. When you have
learned more of the world, Miss Rose, you will
know that there is a good share of glitter that
is not gold. He and Stuart would have had
ever so much more money.”</p>

<p>“You wrong them both. You are unjust to
them.”</p>

<p>“O,” he said, rather sneeringly, “you girls
can get up quite a sentiment for each other;
but boys take a thing for what it is worth.
Neither of them loves me; and I can’t say
there is much love lost between us.”</p>

<p>“I wish you felt differently about them.
And you have just been so ill, too!”</p>

<p>“I told him that I wouldn’t go nor stay with
Stuart. He torments my very life out. I begged
him to send me somewhere else. And no, he
would not. He treats me as if I were about
ten years old, and did not know what was best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
for myself. He cannot think that I am almost
as much of a man as he is!”</p>

<p>He uttered this in a rapid breath, and then
gasped from exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Don’t excite yourself so,” I pleaded. “If
you could have heard Stephen talk of you
when he was here! He begged us to make it
as pleasant and take as much interest in you as
we could.”</p>

<p>“You have been very kind. I do not want
to be ungrateful; but he doesn’t care for me in
that way. He thwarts every plan, he refuses
every wish, and did not even want me to try
for college. He would like to keep me a little
boy at school half my life, I do believe.”</p>

<p>I went around pretending to tidy the room a
bit; but Mrs. Whitcomb had left it as neat as
a pin. I could not bear to have him talk this
way against Stephen. Then I espied a book,
and asked if I should read to him.</p>

<p>“If you will,” was the rather indifferent
answer.</p>

<p>But he was soon quite interested. He turned
towards me, and his eyes grew eager, and over
his whole face came a peaceful light. It seemed
then as if there was quite a resemblance between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
him and the elder brother, for I remembered
that Stephen had a stern way of shutting his
mouth. Louis’s eyes were dark, and that
gave him a more desperate look when he was
angry.</p>

<p>He was very full of whims and wants, but a
while after dinner concluded he would take a
nap. As baby Edith had gone to peaceful slumbers,
and Nelly sat in the nursery, mamma had
taken this opportunity to begin cutting Fan’s
dress. So I joined the conclave, and helped
discuss the momentous question.</p>

<p>Mamma was a born genius. I don’t know
which gift or grace was the strongest. I think
she must have had a very evenly-balanced head.
And yet she used to tell us how really helpless she
was at her marriage. She had lived with a great-aunt,
who was a whimsical invalid, and did
nothing but go to school, and read to, or amuse,
her. Still, I suppose, she learned those grand
lessons of sweetness and patience which helped so
much in her after-life. And when she had to do,
she went to work bravely. She could cook
equal to anybody in the parish; she could make
dresses and bonnets; and when you came to the
altering, she was superb. That was why I called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
her a born genius. Then she had kept up with
her music to some extent, and painted a little
in water colors. Three of papa’s birthday gifts
had been pictures of her painting; and some of
the daintiest fruit-pieces in our dining-room were
done by her in colored crayons on a tinted background.
No wonder we were proud of her.</p>

<p>Now we talked about overskirt and underskirt,
basque, and ruffles, and bands, and trimmings of
various kinds.</p>

<p>“It is quite a fearful undertaking,” said Fan,
with a sigh. “If I had a little more courage,
I’d make it perfectly plain; but, then, when I
went out and saw other people all furbelows
and frills, I am afraid I should be dissatisfied.
And no one would believe it was a new dress.”</p>

<p>“It is better to take a little more trouble
and be satisfied. But I would not have any
ruffles—they are so difficult to iron.”</p>

<p>“Not even one on the skirt?”</p>

<p>“No. I should cut a bias piece in points, and
bind them; or you could have two narrow ones.”</p>

<p>“And I will bind them, as you cannot do
that on the machine very well,” I said.</p>

<p>“You are a good girl, Rose of the World.—Mamma,
I think I’ll have a polonaise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“A sensible conclusion. It will make a nice
outside garment for all summer.”</p>

<p>“And I will just point the sleeves and the skirt.
There is cheap trimming for you. Give me
credit for another bright idea. And a bias-band
pointed on both sides for the underskirt. So
there is the whole garment provided for. Then
I shall have another errand to the store, to get
some pique braid;” and Fan gave a droll little
smile.</p>

<p>Mamma began to cut. Fan opened the machine,
and sewed the skirt breadths together.
The trimming was measured, and she shaped the
points to her fancy. Then mamma fitted the
waist with fingers as deft as any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">modiste</i>.</p>

<p>“Mamma, if you were reduced to absolute
penury, you could set up dress-making,” Fanny
said.</p>

<p>“I have found it very useful without the
absolute penury,” returned mamma, with a wise
smile. “When one has seven girls, a good
many dresses are needed.”</p>

<p>“Are you sorry there are so many of us?”</p>

<p>“I do not know which one I would like to
give up,” was the grave reply.</p>

<p>“It would be like the Irishman with his flock—wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
it? Every one of us has some special
gift or grace. Mine is simply a grace—winning
ways and curly hair. O, there’s Miss Churchill,
and this hall all in a litter!”</p>

<p>The hall was so wide and airy that we used
to sit there and sew in the summer. Mamma
was cutting on the table; so she just gathered
the pieces together, and pushed out papa’s
chintz-covered arm-chair. I sat by the window,
crocheting some tiny garments for baby Edith.
Fan opened the hall door wide before Miss
Churchill could ring to announce herself. Mamma
shook hands with her cordially.</p>

<p>The Churchills were some of the old families
in the town. Oddly enough, they had never
intermarried with their neighbors, but kept to
themselves, and were considered rather haughty
and exclusive. They lived over on the west
side, which was the aristocratic part of the
town, there being no mills or factories near.</p>

<p>Miss Esther Churchill, our visitor, was a tall,
elegant woman of perhaps forty-five. Mr.
Kenton Churchill, the head of the family, was
about ten years older. Next to him came Mrs.
Ogden, who had lived abroad a great deal, and
was now a widow, but wealthy, with one son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and one daughter. Then there was Miss Lucy,
much younger, an invalid, injured quite early
in life by being thrown from a horse. They
were refined and particularly nice people, with
those little formal ways that always kept us in
awe. Their house was very handsome, and it
seemed as if they must have everything that
heart could wish for. They always paid for
two of the best pews in church, one of which
they used, while the other was considered free.
Then Mr. Churchill subscribed liberally to nearly
every charitable object; but, somehow, they
never mixed much with the congregation; yet
they were always spoken of in the highest terms.
Papa and mamma were always invited over to
tea once a year, and they called occasionally.
Miss Esther had made a state call upon baby
Edith, bringing her a handsome cap and cloak.
Mamma had not returned that; so we were a
little surprised, and, to use a provincialism,
“put about,” for an instant. But mamma has
such a wonderful grace and self-possession that
there was no awkwardness.</p>

<p>“How do you do, young ladies? Quite busy,
I see;” and she shook hands with both. “How
cosy and summery you look here. Why, it is
quite like a picture!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>The broad hall was covered with matting.
There was a large, old-fashioned hat-stand on
one side, very much like the beautiful new ones
coming into fashion. It had quite a large glass,
and drawers under it, with branching arms out
both sides. On either side of it was a quaint,
high-backed chair. They might have come over
in the Mayflower, but I don’t suppose they
did. A tall vase of ivy stood on the floor, the
green branches climbing over some picture-frames;
and there were several brackets hanging about,
holding vases of flowers, besides a luxuriant
fernery, that had received contributions from all
of us. The hall door opened on one side, while
the stairs went up on the other, and in this
sort of shut-off corner was our work-room.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is quite like a picture,” she went
on. “It seems to me that a hall should be
the largest and most beautiful part of the house,
and that the family ought to be gathered there.
I like the old-fashioned descriptions of people
dining in their hall, or giving audience.”</p>

<p>“And we add sewing on to that,” said Fan,
with a little laugh. “Instead of Carrara marble,
we have multiplication tables.”</p>

<p>“We have been somewhat straitened for room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
latterly,” mamma explained; “for, when baby is
asleep we like to keep it quiet in the nursery;
and papa’s study is the one spot that we never
invade with sewing.”</p>

<p>“It is like keeping one grand lady in the
house,” Fan added, in her bright way. “And
it gives one a feeling of the utmost respectability.”</p>

<p>Miss Churchill smiled at that. She would always
be a handsome woman, though I don’t
imagine any one had ever called her a pretty
girl; she was too large and grand. Her forehead
was broad, her hair smooth as satin, a
peculiar unglossy brown, and it always gave me
the idea of a rich lustreless silk. Her eyes were
very nearly of the same shade; her chin broad
and firm, and her teeth wonderfully white, strong
and even. Then she had a rather pale but perfect
complexion.</p>

<p>“What a quaint child you are!” and she
seated herself gracefully in the arm-chair, “Mrs.
Endicott, you might be some historical personage
with her maids of honor about her. That
is what <em>my</em> thought is like. And you <em>do</em> look
so sociable! I have been calling on the Maynards;
and you would be surprised at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
amount of thinking I have done between there
and here. My seeing you has just put it into
shape. Or, I suppose, it started with something
that Lucy said as I was coming out.”</p>

<p>“How is Lucy?!” asked mamma.</p>

<p>“Rather poorly. And then she has been a
good deal disappointed. We were expecting
Mrs. Ogden and Helen; and Lucy counts so
much on that every summer! But the Fates
have overruled. They go to Newport for the
whole season. Word came three days ago. I
have hardly known how to entertain Lucy
since.”</p>

<p>“Does she not go out?”</p>

<p>“Only for about half an hour; her back is so
weak that it fatigues her.”</p>

<p>“Yet I should not think she would ever get
tired of reading and looking at your beautiful
pictures, and all the rest. There is so much,
that by the time I reached the end, the first
part would be new to me again,” Fan said.</p>

<p>“You think that, because you can have a
constant variety. And sixteen carries with it
a glamour which fades afterwards. Do you not
find it so, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>Mamma blushed and looked puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“We have another sight at youth through our
children’s eyes,” she answered, softly.</p>

<p>“I do believe it is true. That is why you
keep your youth and freshness through all the—”</p>

<p>“Hard work and worries,” appended mamma,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“I did not like to say quite that. The people
of now-a-days seldom approve of such
wholesome confessions.”</p>

<p>“But it is our business to set a good example,
and not to be ashamed of the duties of that
state of life unto which it pleases God to call
us,” mamma returned.</p>

<p>“We get out of that safe fold sometimes, I
am afraid; or, perhaps, we contract the ‘state,’
make it narrower than God meant it should be.”</p>

<p>What had happened to Miss Churchill? I
glanced at her in shy amaze. She was gracious,
elegant, and formal on most of the occasions
when I had met her.</p>

<p>“Yes; we are rather prone to put up fences.
And we never know how much pleasure we
shut out along with the persons.”</p>

<p>“That is like my thought, too. I was going
to tell you of my call at the Maynards. First,
though, I must acknowledge that I was feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
a trifle down-hearted on Lucy’s account. I
have my house-keeping, and gardening, and driving
out with brother, and rarely get lonesome.
But Lucy stays so much in her room, and Kenton
is so fond of being in his study, that we
may be said to lead almost separate lives. I
was thinking it over as I came along. The servant
ushered me into the shaded drawing-room,
where the atmosphere was close and sultry with
the odor of flowers. Then Mrs. Maynard sent
for me to come to her room, where she was
taking comfort in a dressing-sacque. She bewailed
the loneliness and stupidity of the place,
and thought of going to Saratoga. Then Etta
Silverthorne called me into her room. She was
lying on the bed reading a novel, and had the
same story to tell. I asked for the young ladies,
and found that Josephine wanted to see me particularly
about a list of books. Would I come
to her? Emily was copying one of Lucy’s paintings,
and I must journey to her studio up-stairs.
Then I had to make a call on grandmother,
who was very lonesome, and glad to have a little
talk with some one. The girls were so busy
they could only run in a moment at a time;
Mrs. Silverthorne was so fond of reading that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
she could not bear to be disturbed, and she hated
to read aloud; Mrs. Maynard had the care of the
house, of course. ‘And so I sit here alone
pretty nearly all the time,’ said poor old grandmother.”</p>

<p>“And she is such a nice, enjoyable old lady,
too!” mamma remarked.</p>

<p>“There were five women, capable of interesting
and amusing each other, all longing for society.
Why did it not occur to them that they might
have a sociable at home? I came directly here,
and saw three little girls having a tea-party under
a tree, and three here, looking bright and
animated. You don’t wonder now that I was
taken with the picture!”</p>

<p>“An interior. Still life, after—” mamma said,
quaintly, as if she were reading a title.</p>

<p>“And we were not so very still either,” added
Fanny. “We were taxing our inventive faculties
in the dress-making line. We wanted something
pretty with a little work and a little money.
A new dress is a great event in our lives. We
generally step into each other’s, have them taken
up a trifle on the shoulders, and the skirts
shortened. But I have had the misfortune to
outgrow Rose; so the family exchequer has to
be squeezed now and then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>I was amazed at her daring to say so much
to Miss Churchill. However, she laughed in
such a pretty, whole-hearted way that I had no
further misgiving.</p>

<p>“Seven girls! Is that the number? How do
you ever get the dress-making done? It is the
staple grievance of nearly every one I know.”</p>

<p>“We do not have many dresses,” said irrepressible
Fan; “and our pattern being small, the
puffs and rufflings have to be dispensed with.
So we are saved the trouble of deciding between
biassed tucking up and down the gores, and of
fluted bobbinet insertion box-plaited beyond the
equator, that drove the man crazy when he tried
to carry his wife’s message to the dress maker.”</p>

<p>“I should think it would.” And this time
Miss Churchill laughed heartily. “How fortunate
you are to be able to do your own! though I
think every woman ought to have some knowledge
of it.”</p>

<p>“Every woman ought to know enough of
something to support herself by it, if the necessity
comes.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And do you know, now that there is so
much talk of independence, I am afraid many of
our girls are making a sad mistake? They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
all trying to rush into the very front ranks,
whether they are geniuses or not; and some of
them will be crowded out. There will be no
nice home girls left. But perhaps these young
ladies have a vocation?” and she glanced up
with a charming, lady-like hesitation.</p>

<p>“Rose will be a home girl, Miss Churchill.
The credit of our family will be saved. But I
can’t decide whether I have a great deal of
genius, and could do anything, or whether my
range is so limited that the right thing would
be difficult to find. I could not write a book,
or lecture, or edit a newspaper. I might paint
a second-rate picture, or, possibly, teach school;
but I should not like the last.”</p>

<p>“Fanny!” said mamma in mild reproof.</p>

<p>“I know what she would be excellently fitted
for,” replied Miss Churchill, quickly. “And
that emboldens me to offer my plea, or, rather,
my sister’s. But how thoughtless I am! Mrs.
Endicott, I did not hear of your added burden
and anxiety until a few days ago. I am sincerely
sorry that you should have had so much
trouble outside of your own family, as the serious
illness of this young Duncan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it has been rather unfortunate; but we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
are through the worst, I hope. Mr. Endicott is
guardian for these boys.”</p>

<p>“He is extremely kind and conscientious, I am
sure. But I can hardly understand how you
manage, with all the rest of your work. There
comes Kenton and the carriage, and I feel as if
I had not made half a call.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you need not hurry,” exclaimed
mamma, who had warmed wonderfully towards
our visitor. “And you had something to ask—for
your sister.”</p>

<p>“O, I am positively ashamed to. I ought to
help instead of hindering.”</p>

<p>“Ask it, nevertheless,” said mamma.</p>

<p>“I told Lucy that I was going to call here;
and, as I said, she was feeling quite dispirited
and lonesome. ‘Give them all my kindest
regards,’ she said, ‘and ask Mrs. Endicott if she
cannot spare one of the girls to spend the day
with me. I’d like to have the one who talks a
good deal.’ Is it a compliment to you, Miss
Fanny?”</p>

<p>Fan blushed scarlet.</p>

<p>“I was thinking, a few moments ago, that
you, with your bright spirits, would be invaluable
to invalids. But I suppose you can hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
spare her out of your sick room.” And she
glanced at mamma.</p>

<p>“O, Miss Churchill, you rate me too highly,”
returned Fanny. “Rose is a charming and sensible
nurse. I never try nursing.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Whitcomb has been staying with us,
and our sick room has had to be kept very
quiet,” said mamma. “Fanny would do better
where society is needed.”</p>

<p>“And that is just Lucy’s case. Now, Miss
Fanny, if your mamma <em>can</em> spare you, I will
sew on your dress, or do anything to help make
up the time.”</p>

<p>“If it would really be any pleasure, I can
readily consent to her going,” mamma responded.</p>

<p>“It would, indeed. I do not think I realized
how busy you all must be, or I should not have
had the courage to prefer my request. And I
hope you will not consider that I have taken a
liberty in bringing a few articles for your
patient.”</p>

<p>With that she rose, and went down the path
to her brother, who handed a snowy basket out
to her.</p>

<p>“I ventured to put in a few fine summer
pears besides: those are for the children. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
now, Mrs. Endicott, what day will your daughter
be most at liberty? Are you quite sure that
I am not asking too much?”</p>

<p>“We shall be very glad to grant what you
desire,” was the sweet reply. “Our days are
pretty much alike.”</p>

<p>“Would to-morrow be too soon? And bring
your dress, for I can sew beautifully on a machine,
and I fancy I have some skill in that
art. I have had such a pleasant call that I hate
to go. Miss Rose, come over any time; we
shall be glad to see you. My kindest regards
to Mr. Endicott. Is there anything that I can
do for you?”</p>

<p>“Not just now. Thank you most kindly.”
And mamma walked with her to the gate.</p>

<p>“Don’t they look lovely together!” exclaimed
Fan. “Mamma is as much of a lady as Miss
Churchill.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“O mamma</span>, wonders will never cease!”
exclaimed Fan. “To think that I
should be singled out for such favors!
Why, Kate Fairlie would die of envy
this blessed moment, if she knew it!”</p>

<p>“And how charming Miss Churchill was!” I
said.</p>

<p>“She is a very lovely woman, and she was
unusually cordial to-day.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it was that she—wanted a
favor?” asked Fanny, slowly.</p>

<p>“No my dear. I think she told the simple
truth. They were lonesome at home, and the
unsocial element at the Maynards’ jarred upon
her. Our homelikeness, if I may use the word,
just fitted in with her longing. It always
appeared to me such an unwise fashion of the
members of a family meeting only at meals. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
am not willing to be shut out of your lives, my
girls.”</p>

<p>“And you shall not be, mamma <em>mia</em>. We will
share our sorrows, and joys, and new dresses.
I’ll talk of sublime resignation to poverty, and
then make visits in aristocratic circles.”</p>

<p>“And in the meanwhile we might try on this
garment. But, my dear, do not let your spirits
run away with you. Flippancy is not brightness.”</p>

<p>“How we all sat and sewed!” exclaimed Fan.
“It did not seem the least bit awkward. At
all events, I cut and Rose crocheted. All that
trimming is ready. Oh, Rose, it is mean for
me to take all the good things of life.”</p>

<p>I thought my head would go off in that rapturous
hug. And I was glad that I was not a
bit jealous.</p>

<p>Mamma gave a pinch here, and a pull there,
and, behold Fan’s dress fitted after the similitude
of a glove.</p>

<p>“It is just lovely!” was Fan’s ecstatic comment.
“Kate Fairlie and Sue Barstow will die
of envy when they see it. Now I shall have
just time enough to run up the seams. Of
course, mamma, you wouldn’t think of taking
it?” and Fan gave an inquiring glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“No, indeed, though it was kind in Miss
Churchill to say it, since your time was more
precious than hers.”</p>

<p>We began to pick up the pieces and restore
order. Just then papa came in, and baby Edith
woke and cried. Fan rushed at papa and kissed
him rapturously, telling over the whole story in
an instant. She had such a remarkable way of
going to the point of anything without loss of
time.</p>

<p>“Really!” he exclaimed; “I am glad she
asked you. You can do a little work for the
good cause to-morrow, Fanny.”</p>

<p>“O, papa, it is to be a whole long holiday!”</p>

<p>“You lazy little girl!”</p>

<p>“Papa, if you do not treat me real handsomely,
I will go over to the strong-minded ‘sisteren,’
and write a book, or lecture, or something.”</p>

<p>“I am willing you should lecture. I will give
you a subject: ‘The rich and poor meet together,
and the Lord is Maker of them all.’”</p>

<p>“There, Fan!” And it was my turn to laugh.</p>

<p>Fan shook her head solemnly.</p>

<p>“It did not frighten him a bit,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, my dear; since there is room for so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
much work in the world. I have often wished
the Churchills and several others would come
out of their shells, or their beautiful Edens,
and go at some of the thistles beyond their
gates.”</p>

<p>“Poor people have such splendid ideas—don’t
they, papa? But then rich people have all the
money.”</p>

<p>“There is something needed besides money.
If rich people could only see how many nice
and pleasant gifts and favors they could bestow
without lowering themselves, which so many people
are afraid of, ladies especially. The majority
of the poor and ignorant are no more anxious to
come up to their level, than they are to have
them.”</p>

<p>“We are lucky to be on the middle ground,”
said Fan. “We cannot be accused of undue ambition,
or be snubbed very severely. And yet I do
think it just lovely to be rich, and I always shall.”</p>

<p>“My dear, so do I,” returned papa, gravely.
“And we should endeavor not to array wealth
against us. We may in time soften some of the
prejudices on both sides. People need to see
soul to soul, and not stop at the burr outside.”</p>

<p>The tinkle of a small bell reached me. I rose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
sorely against my will, not daring to linger in
the family bosom of temptation. The young
man up stairs was continually interfering in
some way. Just when you were having a nice
talk, you were compelled to leave off in the
middle and run away, or some one ran away
from you. Why, it was as bad as parish visiting.
But there <em>was</em> the money at the end of it—mercenary
little wretch that I had become!</p>

<p>Yet you cannot live in the world superior to
all such considerations, if you are poor. I know
the lilies are gorgeously arrayed, and the ravens
fed; but, when you are <em>not</em> a lily, or not a
raven, and the wants and the work come, you
must endure the one, and go courageously at
the other.</p>

<p>At this point in my reflections I entered the
room and encountered the wan, eager eyes.</p>

<p>“Did I interrupt you, or call you away from
something pleasant? I am so sorry. I was so
lonesome, and—”</p>

<p>It was a good deal for him to say. Had we
changed places and was <em>I</em> ungracious?</p>

<p>“It was not anything special. Have you been
long awake?”</p>

<p>“More than an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Then it is I who ought to apologize,” I
said, cheerfully. “Can I get you anything?—Are
you not hungry?”</p>

<p>“I would like to have a drink of good, cold
water. I am a deal of trouble, am I not?”</p>

<p>“If I were sick I would like some one to
wait upon me,” I said, and ran down stairs.—Ann
was at the end of the garden, picking berries;
so I drew the water myself; and as I
brought the bucket up to the curb, the woman
of Samaria came into my mind. If I could
give any such comfort of living water! Did I
really desire to? So far I had done barely
what was required of me. It did not look half
as enchanting as reading to and amusing Miss
Lucy Churchill. But wasn’t there a good work
in it as well?</p>

<p>I entered the room with a glass pitcher,
through which the water shone and sparkled.
There was such a thirsty, longing look in his
eyes that I was glad to minister to him.</p>

<p>“Thank you a thousand times. I have been
wanting that for the last half hour.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not ring sooner?”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“You had a visitor; and I call for so many
things. There appears to be no end to my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>wants. I am ashamed of myself. But it is so
tiresome to lie here helpless.”</p>

<p>“What would be the next thing, if I were a
fairy?” I asked, laughingly.</p>

<p>Was it my mood that made him smile?</p>

<p>“There is a tantalizing smell of honeysuckle
somewhere about. Nay, don’t run down stairs
again.”</p>

<p>“It is just on the porch.”</p>

<p>Mamma was emptying Miss Churchill’s basket.
A bowl of custard, a jar of wine jelly, fresh
eggs, a great, creamy pot-cheese, and the pears.
I just took a whiff of the fragrance and passed
on.</p>

<p>“Let me have a piece of it here in my hand.”</p>

<p>“How odd that you should be so fond of
flowers!”</p>

<p>“Is it? Sweet blooms only. May be you
would not approve of such a love. I like to
crush them and have them about me. Not but
what I admire them in vases, too, but then they
do not come into my very life.”</p>

<p>“Or die for you.”</p>

<p>I had said it, and then I paused in a great
tremble, thinking of the other death that came
through love, greater than which hath no man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Endicott,” he said, slowly, “are you
very religious?”</p>

<p>I colored, and turned my face away; then I
thought of “confessing before men.” What
should make me afraid here, except the sense of
personal unworthiness?</p>

<p>“I try a little. I have not gone very far in
the way.”</p>

<p>“I know some people who are <em>very</em> religious,”
he went on, “and I—dislike them. That was
another reason why I did not want to come here—because
your father was a clergyman. But
you always appear to have such nice, enjoyable
times. You talk over everything with him and
your mother.”</p>

<p>“Why should we not? It would be strange
if they were not interested in all that concerns
us. And bringing home a bit of pleasant talk
or some bright and amusing incident is like
adding a sheaf to the general granary. Does it
not seem as if each one ought to contribute
to the fund of happiness?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is a good deal in the way you
look at it. And the having a home, may be.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “that is the great thing, or
next to the having a mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“What if I were seized with a fit of confessing
my sins? Would that be added to the ‘general
fund?’”</p>

<p>“I think we have all been brought up to respect
a confidence,” I answered, a trifle wounded.
“But it would be better to confess them to
papa.”</p>

<p>“I might not want to;” and he gave a
short laugh that did not seem at all natural.
“In fact, there are very few people who
suit me, or attract me—the same can, doubtless,
be said of me. Do you know—and I have
never owned it before in my life—I am sometimes
jealous of Stuart? Every one takes to
him, likes him; and he is no better than—other
people. He is not always truthful; he <em>is</em> awfully
selfish, and heartless, too. Only he has
that sunny, glowing way with him; and most
people are such fools that they cannot see
through it. So he gets credit for sweetness,
when it is only—”</p>

<p>“A matter of temperament,” I returned, filling
up the long pause.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Why cannot others understand
that it is so?”</p>

<p>“Because nearly every one likes roses better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
than thorns. We naturally shrink from a rough,
prickly outside. No matter if the kernel is
sweet, every one, you know, cannot wait years
and years for it to open. And you seem to
shut yourself up—”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to show, so I make no
pretence,” he answered, in a dry, hard tone.—“I
hate froth, and all that.”</p>

<p>“Yet I suppose the waterfall is much prettier
for the spray and bubbles. Frail as they are,
they reflect many beautiful tints. And I suppose
God could have made apples just as well
without such showers of fragrant blooms, and
He may put some people in the world for the
sake of the blossom and the sweetness rather
than the fruit.”</p>

<p>“What an idea! I should think you would
be educated to consider the strictly useful.”</p>

<p>“But all things that God has made have their
uses.”</p>

<p>“You keep to the text—that God does it
all. It is a woman’s province to believe, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>There was a little sneer in that.</p>

<p>“Does unbelief render men so much happier
that they love to cling to it?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, they are dipping into science and philosophy,
and see so much more of the world,”
he replied, loftily.</p>

<p>I turned to the window—and was silent.</p>

<p>“There!” he exclaimed, “I have vexed you.”</p>

<p>“No.” I returned, “I am not vexed. I only
wish I knew the right words to say to you;
mamma might.”</p>

<p>“You are all very kind. I wonder that you
were so good, when the beginning was so unpromising.
You must have thought us a couple
of brutes.”</p>

<p>“Stuart apologized handsomely to papa.”</p>

<p>“O, I dare say. He is up to that sort of
dodge;” and a smile of scorn curled his thin
lip.</p>

<p>“I wish you loved your brothers better,” I
could not forbear saying.</p>

<p>“It is their loss, no doubt.”</p>

<p>What could I do with him in such a mood?
“Preaching,” as Fan called it, was useless. Then
I bethought myself of Miss Churchill’s call, and
told him what she had brought for him.</p>

<p>“And now,” I said, “it is time you had your
supper. You must be nearly starved.”</p>

<p>With that I ran down stairs. Yes, I did like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
bright, pleasant people. Mamma’s cheery ways
and papa’s sweetness were worth more than doses
of science and philosophy, since we have to live
in a work-day world, and cannot soar up to the
clouds. It is just the every-day being that is
life, not the grand dreams that never come to
pass.</p>

<p>I prepared the tray and took it, standing it
on a table at the bed’s side. When I returned
the little group were in their accustomed places,
with papa ready to ask the blessing. I slipped
quietly into the circle.</p>

<p>When I went to bring the dishes down I
remarked a peculiar expression upon Louis’ face.</p>

<p>“Miss Rose,” he began, “I want to know
how it feels to be generous; therefore I shall
give you a holiday this evening. I must resolve
to stay alone now and then.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure—?”</p>

<p>“Quite;” and he waved his hand, smilingly.</p>

<p>I did want to go down to the store with Fan;
so I was glad of the permission. Stuart started
to accompany us but two of the village boys
came to call on him. I was relieved, for I
wanted to stop on the way and see one of my
Sunday School children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>Fan bought her braid, and we found the baby
at the Day’s was sick, and Betty had to stay at
home to help take care of it. Poor thing, how
wild and wan it looked, so different from our
rosy Edith.</p>

<p>Mrs. Day’s house was generally in disorder.
She was a hard-working woman in some respects,
for she was always at it. Her husband was a
gardener and day-laborer, earning his twelve
dollars a week pretty regularly, and they owned
a small cottage and garden, that Mrs. Day senior
had left them. Yet they always looked very poor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Day was saying, “I couldn’t
spare Betty on Sunday. Husband went over
the river to see his cousin, and took little Jem.
I’d been hard at work all the week, and was
clear beat out, up half the night, too. And I
don’t see as the baby gets a bit better. You
don’t know what it is to look after a baby all
alone by yourself, and not have a soul to raise
a finger for you.”</p>

<p>“But Betty helps a good deal.” I returned,
for I could not bear to have the child so underrated.</p>

<p>“A girl like that can’t do much at the best.
Now, if I had one or two grown up, as your
mother has!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>She always thought if she only had something
another person possessed, she should be happier.
I wondered a little how she would get along
with mamma’s cares and worries, and sewing,
to say nothing of the demands from outside.</p>

<p>“Ask your ma if she cannot come over.
Hardly a soul has been in, and I can’t go anywhere
for a bit of change. But poor people
have to do the best they can in trouble.”</p>

<p>I promised, and spoke a few words of cheer
to sad-eyed Betty.</p>

<p>“That woman always does try me!” declared
Fan. “If I was a minister’s wife she would be
a thorn in my side. How many poor, inefficient
people there are in this world, and the worst
feature appears to be their inability to learn anything!
I do not believe they try in good earnest.”</p>

<p>“Yet I feel sorry for her.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, and the poor sick baby. But if
her room had been swept, her dishes taken to
the kitchen, and her hair combed, and a collar
on, how it would have altered the aspect of the
place! And she seems to think every one else
in the world has it so much easier.”</p>

<p>“This is one of the places where one must
not weary in well-doing, papa would say,” was
my rejoinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“You are a good little girl, Rose. I have
not half your faith or patience. I wonder if I
shall be of any real and sensible use in this
world?”</p>

<p>“You can try to-morrow. The house will be
clean.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I should not want to go, otherwise,”
she returned, laughingly.</p>

<p>The man came over for her the next morning,
quite early, having been to the village on business.
We felt that she was going off in state,
but I suppose it was on account of its being
the West Side and the Churchills, for Fan
somehow was fortunate in having plenty of
rides fall to her share. She uttered a laughing
good-bye and they drove away.</p>

<p>It seems odd how one event comes out of
another, like the wonderful Chinese transformations.
You open a ball and the article inside is
one you would never have guessed at. You go
to some place, and one trifling incident changes
the course of one’s whole life, or a few words
that some person utters carelessly brings about
a new train of thought and action, and your
life is not quite the same afterward.</p>

<p>The Churchill mansion had a look of the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
nobility. It was two stories, with a great, double
pitched roof, and wide, overhanging eaves.
Just the old fashion of white and green. But
the blinds were never faded, and the exterior
never soiled. A porch on the front and one side,
upheld by square, white columns, and on the
other side the graveled roadway to the barn.
A lawn in front, terraced twice, with clumps of
blossoming shrubs, or dainty beds cut out sharply
in the grass. For the house stood on a slight
hill which gave it a still more commanding
appearance.</p>

<p>But around, just a trifle removed, to let in
the sunshine, stood the glory of it all. Great
trees, elms, maples, a giant black-walnut, hemlocks
that must have grown nearly a hundred
years, firs, spruce and larches waving their long
fringy arms. No modern sacrilegious hands had
come near to disturb them. Birds built in their
branches year after year, and the sunshine sifted
through on the grass.</p>

<p>It was a warm morning and Miss Lucy’s reclining
chair had been wheeled out to the shady
side of the porch. She was dressed in white
with pale pink roses in her hair and at her
throat. Just turned of thirty she had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
Churchill maturity with a certain delicate girlishness.
You could imagine Miss Esther being
a handsome and stately old woman, but it seemed
as if Miss Lucy must always stay where she
was.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill came to help her out, Miss
Esther welcomed her warmly, and Lucy put
forth her hand with a smile.</p>

<p>“I was afraid we might be too early, but
Abner had to go over on business, and we told
him to wait if you were not ready. Did you
have a pleasant ride?”</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you to come. I hope I
shall not tire you out before the day is over,”
said Miss Lucy.</p>

<p>“O, you will not, I am sure,” Fanny returned
with her bright smile. “I am delighted
to come.”</p>

<p>“And the sewing?” Miss Churchill exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I did all the long seams last evening, and
Rose is to bind my trimming for me, but I am
much obliged.”</p>

<p>“What industrious girls you are. I am almost
conscience smitten. Are you quite sure you
could be spared?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. Don’t think of that please,
Miss Churchill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“Will you sit here awhile? The air is so
fresh and fragrant. The greater part of my
going out amounts to this only, so I am thankful
for the beautiful prospect. Look at those
woods over there.”</p>

<p>Another knoll dark with evergreens as tall as
those around the house. At a little distance an
adjoining hill, but in the level opening between,
there was a field of ripening wheat which looked
like a golden sea. Fan spoke of it.</p>

<p>“How odd,” returned Miss Lucy, “I have
had the same thought dozens of times in the
last fortnight. I sometimes imagine that there
is a lovely undiscovered country just beyond,
and what it is like. I am glad that I cannot go
out to discover it, that would take away half
the charm.”</p>

<p>Fanny smiled at the quaint conceit, so satisfying.</p>

<p>“And now tell me all about the children at
home, and the sick young man? What do you
think Dr. Hawley said to me a few days ago?—Miss
Lucy, you need some one to bring you a
good dish of gossip.”</p>

<p>“Good gossip at that;” laughed Mr. Churchill
with a humorous twinkle in his eye. “If Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Endicott does not acquit herself well, I’ll go for
some of the village cronies.”</p>

<p>“I’ll begin with the baby then,” and Fanny
moved her seat a trifle. “She is just the cunningest
baby you ever saw. We were all smart
children, but she is a prodigy. She sits alone,
and creeps a little sideways, and when she gets
in a glee, flaps her wings, i. e. her arms, and
crows.”</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill shook his head solemnly. “That
will hardly do for a girl,” he said, “and a
clergyman’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“We think it best for her to do her crowing
while she is small,” was Fannie’s playful answer.</p>

<p>She talked about the others—Fan had a way
of brightening up everything that was very
amusing. Not that she ever made it out better
or worse—it was only the quaint touches of
harmless pleasantry.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy laughed softly and a pink tint came
to her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Miss Esther in the meanwhile made several
journeys to and fro. Mr. Churchill took up his
paper and pretended to read, but his eyes wandered
to the fair young girl whose simple homelikeness
was her greatest charm. Presently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
sun came around, and Miss Lucy’s chair was
wheeled to the sitting room, which was cool and
shady.</p>

<p>All their entertainments were not kept for
the great drawing-room. Here were pictures, a
well filled book-case, articles of <em>virtu</em>, a cabinet
of shells, minerals and precious stones, and portfolios
of fine engravings. Here an album filled
with notable authors, artists and musical people,
another with eminent men of Europe, and remarkable
women. Fan had enough to entertain
her there.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bell rang.</p>

<p>“This is the shortest morning that I have
known for some time,” exclaimed Miss Lucy.
“It hardly seems possible that is the dinner bell.
We are old fashioned in our hour, you see.”</p>

<p>Fan was astonished as well. Mr. Churchill
gave Lucy his arm, as she could walk with a
little assistance. Miss Esther led Fanny.</p>

<p>The dinner table was like a picture. The
quaint old china, delicately flowered, and the
antique silver was set off by the snowy cloth
and the brilliant bouquets with trailing stems that
looked as if they might have grown in the vases.
Fan enjoyed it all to the uttermost, and was too
happy to envy aught of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“You have been sitting up all the morning;”
said Miss Churchill, “and you do not look a bit
tired now! Shall we give Miss Fanny the
credit?”</p>

<p>“I think she deserves it. Indeed I hardly
noticed how the time passed. You see I get so
tired of staying alone, or talking over the same
old subjects with Essie.”</p>

<p>“You are a grateful young woman I must
say!” and Miss Churchill laughed.</p>

<p>“Kenton, couldn’t we have a drive to Round
Hill about sunset? I think I could go.”</p>

<p>“What, more dissipation?”</p>

<p>“Please don’t undertake too much,” said
Fanny. “I am well content to stay here.”</p>

<p>“But the sunset is so lovely there.”</p>

<p>“You must have a good long rest;” said her
sister, “and we will see how you feel then.”</p>

<p>“I dare say Miss Endicott will be glad for I
have kept her talking steadily.”</p>

<p>“I am used to it,” laughed Fan, “and somehow
I never understood the charms of solitude,
or perhaps was born incapable of appreciating
them.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of that;” Mr. Churchill
returned with a quiet smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>They sat over their dessert a long while,
talking of various subjects that were exceedingly
entertaining. The quiet and air of formal courtesy
that was far removed from stiffness, pleased
and interested Fanny greatly.</p>

<p>But Miss Churchill was inexorable afterward,
and would not even consent to Fan’s going up
stairs with Lucy. Instead she took charge of
her and they inspected the house and the clean,
fragrant dairy, and lastly found themselves in
Miss Churchill’s room. This was large and airy,
looking cool in its summer dress of matting and
furniture of cane or delicate chintz covers.</p>

<p>The visit was so different from the formal little
calls that we had been in the habit of making
with either of our parents. Indeed, Fan always
declared that this day’s experience took her right
into the Churchills’ lives, and I think it did.</p>

<p>A dress of fine white India muslin lay on
Miss Churchill’s bed. At least, the skirt which
had three ruffles edged with delicate needlework.
The rest had been ripped apart and ironed out.</p>

<p>“Do you think it pretty?” asked Miss Churchill.</p>

<p>“It is lovely. What exquisite muslin! I
wonder what makes these old things so much
more beautiful than what we have now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“They are neater and not so showy.”</p>

<p>“But this would be noticeable anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yet it has an air of quiet refinement.
Twenty or thirty years ago ladies bought dresses
to keep, now they are unpardonably old after
one or two seasons, therefore it does not pay to
make them so elegant. My dear Miss Fanny, I
may as well confess to a conspiracy. I brought
out a lot of old dresses yesterday—too pretty
to give to the absolute poor. I selected this
and altered the skirt. It is all done but the
band. I did not know precisely what to do
with the waist, so I shall have to give you the
material. And if you will accept these for yourself
and your sister—there is a great quantity
in them, and you will find it a nice, serviceable
fabric, as it will save washing. Please do not
consider me officious.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Churchill!” was all that Fan could
say.</p>

<p>“This pine-apple will be good for afternoon
wear, and I believe to some extent in useful
gifts. The other I wanted you to have because
it was so pretty. I have two more, which will
last me my life time.”</p>

<p>“You are too generous! Oh, Miss Churchill,
how can I thank you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“By wearing and enjoying them, my dear,
and not having any fussy feeling over them.
Just as if they had come from an aunt, for
instance. I do not believe your mother will object.
She is too truly a lady to fancy that I
desire to place you under any obligation.”</p>

<p>I should have stood silent and abashed. Fan
did the best thing of all, just clasped her arms
around Miss Churchill’s neck and kissed her for
thanks.</p>

<p>The stage came lumbering along at that moment.
Miss Churchill glanced out of the window
with one arm still around Fanny.</p>

<p>“Of all things! Here is Winthrop Ogden
looking too merry for any misfortune. It is like
him to take us so by surprise. My dear, I will
run down a moment.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Fan</span> heard the sound of the voices without
distinguishing the words, and turned
to an inspection of the dresses. There
was a dainty apron overskirt of the muslin, with
the same lovely ruffling around it, and plenty
for the waist and sleeves. The others were blue
and white striped, one very narrow, the other
about an inch wide, with a kind of embroidered
figure in the stripe. The skirts were long and
full, and with one there was a mantle.</p>

<p>Miss Churchill returned presently.</p>

<p>“You have not mutinied in my absence, have
you? My dear girl, I do not want to place you
under any obligation, yet I thought these garments
might be of some use to you and your
sister. It would not do to send them to the
sewing society to be cut up for the very poor.
Don’t give yourself an anxious thought. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
go in to Lucy who is waiting for you, and when
she is ready you must come down stairs and see
our nephew.”</p>

<p>Miss Lucy was much rested. “I have had
three or four naps which did me a world of
good;” she said. “You see I was very tired,
and that made me rest delightfully. All my
good things come at once. Winthrop is here.”</p>

<p>She looked bright and cheerful.</p>

<p>“Can I not do something for you?” asked
Fanny. “I might brush your hair, I often do
mamma’s.”</p>

<p>“If it would not trouble you—Essie does it in
the morning, and I generally manage it in the
afternoon. But I am afraid—”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Fan cordially, divining the
delicate fear. She took up the brush and soon
had it in order.</p>

<p>Usually Miss Lucy walked about without any
assistance, but being somewhat weak now, she
had to help herself with a cane which she always
kept in her room. Fan tried to anticipate her
wants, and she was ready so soon that she rang
the bell for her brother, who came to assist her
down stairs.</p>

<p>“This is our nephew, Mr. Ogden;” announced
Miss Churchill, “Miss Endicott.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Fan remembered seeing him at church occasionally.
He was about twenty-two, and had
matured considerably in a year. He was medium
height, with a rather handsome, rollicking face.
There was a laugh in his hazel eyes, in his curly
chestnut hair, and it seemed to play hide and
seek about his mouth, the upper lip being shaded
by a soft brown moustache.</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Endicott,—though I ought to
know you without a formal presentation, only I
could not save your life I suppose if I were not
introduced. How are you, Aunt Lucy? Why
you have roses, actually! I thought from Aunt
Essie’s letter that you must be a pale shadow!”</p>

<p>“The roses are in your honor, and not very
durable. I am glad to see you, but oh how you
have—changed!”</p>

<p>“For the better allow me to hope!”</p>

<p>She laughed. “But how did you come to
take us so by surprise? I thought you were at
Newport.”</p>

<p>“I was yesterday. But I had to dance so
much night before last, that I was afraid of
impairing my constitution. I began to sigh for
simple country life, and came hither, thinking
of uncle Kenton’s horses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“They are in a fine condition;” said Mr.
Churchill.</p>

<p>“And I can have only a fortnight’s vacation
now, so I mean to make the most of it. The
other two weeks will come in September.”</p>

<p>“Your mother and Helen—?”</p>

<p>“Are delightfully well and charmingly entertained—can
you ask more?”</p>

<p>He gave a droll little smile at this.</p>

<p>We heard sometime afterward that Miss Ogden
was engaged, and her lover’s mother being very
fond of her, they had gone to Newport somewhat
on her account.</p>

<p>“Come out on the porch. Here is your chair
Lucy,” and Mr. Churchill wheeled it round.
“Why you <em>do</em> look quite bright. Miss Endicott,
we must thank you for part of it.”</p>

<p>“I have not done much, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Lucy, have you a protege, or has
Miss Endicott kindly consented to rule you for
the nonce? Will my occupation be gone?”</p>

<p>“What nonsense, Winthrop! Miss Endicott
came over to spend the day, taking pity on me.
I have been so forlornly lonesome of late.”</p>

<p>“Then I have arrived just in the nick of
time, if that word has any meaning or relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
to anything above or under the waters. Let
me feel your pulse. Quite reduced, I must
admit. Beef tea and camomile flowers three
times a day. A long walk morning and evening.
Cheerful society—a new bonnet—and—but
try that first. My knowledge is not exhausted.”</p>

<p>“Could you take the ride, think, Lucy?”
asked Miss Churchill. “Kenton we will have
the large carriage and all go.”</p>

<p>“What conspiracy have you planned?” inquired
Winthrop.</p>

<p>“A harmless drive,” returned Miss Lucy mirthfully.
“If it looks suspicious we will leave you
at home in Hugo’s charge.”</p>

<p>Hugo was a handsome English hound, as
aristocratic as his master.</p>

<p>They all asked and answered questions, drawing
Fan within their beautiful circle by the fine
tact of thorough breeding. She was so gay and
charming, and withal natural without any aiming
at position or special notice. Indeed she
and Mr. Ogden had two or three passages of
sharpness between them that made their elders
laugh.</p>

<p>It came supper time so soon, that Miss Lucy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
declared gaily she had been defrauded; the day
certainly <em>was</em> shorter than usual.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Mr. Churchill, “they are.
We have passed the longest days.”</p>

<p>“Have you? Sometimes I feel as if I were
just coming to mine,” and there was a graver
look in her face.</p>

<p>“Aunt Lucy low spirited! Why I thought
you were a very princess of philosophy!”</p>

<p>“One’s heart does fail sometimes.”</p>

<p>“But I am to be married you know, and you
are to make me long visits. I’ll save my buttons
for you to sew on, you shall embroider my
initials, and mend my gloves. Will not that be
happiness enough?”</p>

<p>“What is your wife to do meanwhile?”</p>

<p>He affected to be puzzled. “Why I suppose
she will not <em>know</em> how to do anything. Is not
that the accomplishment of the girl of the
period?”</p>

<p>“There may be girls of the semi-colon who
do not go quite so far;” answered Miss Lucy
drolly.</p>

<p>Winthrop glanced up at Fan who colored
vividly.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss Endicott, I—”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“Winthrop you are not to tease Miss Endicott,
nor to classify her, either. I take her
under my especial protection.”</p>

<p>“I lay down my arms at once, Aunt Lucy. I
am your most obedient.”</p>

<p>And so it went on with bits of fun and pleasantness
cropping out now and then. Mr. Churchill
unbending, Miss Churchill straying from the
little hedge of formalities, sweet as a wild briar
blossom. And Lucy was nearly as bright as
Fan.</p>

<p>The carriage came around soon afterwards.
Mr. Ogden insisted upon driving, so the man
was dispensed with. The Churchill estate was
very large, including the mountainous track and
a good deal of woodland. It was not a much
frequented drive, although Round Hill was one
of the curiosities of the town. But the Churchills
and the Garthwaites seemed to fence it in
with their sense of ownership, and it was <em>not</em>
common property like Longmeadow and the
Cascades.</p>

<p>But it was very beautiful in the low lying
light. Here was a field in deep gloom, shadowed
by yonder trees, here a strip of waving grain,
then long sweeps of grassy hillsides broken by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
clumps of young cedars or hemlocks. An irregular
wooded chain—the mountains, Wachusetts’
people called them, divided us from the quaint
little town lying in the next valley. Here was
the delightful opening that appeared more level
by contrast with the tall trees on both sides,
and next, symmetrical Round Hill, in a flood of
golden red light, for the sun was going down
between this and the next eminence.</p>

<p>Fan just turned to Miss Lucy and put out
her hand. But the eloquent words and the intense
appreciation were in her fluttering color,
her swelling lip and kindling eye, and the simple
gesture.</p>

<p>“I knew you would like it;” said Lucy just
as quietly.</p>

<p>Miss Churchill looked over at them. Was she
thinking of what Mrs. Endicott had said—how
she kept young in her children’s lives? For
Lucy’s face was like a girl’s again.</p>

<p>“I sometimes think there can be nothing in
Europe more beautiful,” Miss Lucy said at
length. “It is my Alps. Ah, if one could paint
that glow!”</p>

<p>Winthrop glanced back. “I wish you could
have seen some pictures in the Academy, Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Lucy;” and then he went on to describe them
in an eager manner, evincing much genuine love
for beauty, and a kind of fitness, for his tone
was low and earnest, without any assumption
of manishness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile as they wound slowly along, the
sky changed from the crimson gold, to orange,
then to a yellow tint, sending out long rays
into the frost-white, not unlike an Aurora. All
the edges of the hills were purple and blue,
with a peculiar velvety softness, losing themselves
presently in hazy indistinctness.</p>

<p>“Kenton,” Lucy said, “this place ought to be
re-christened. Sunset Hill would be more appropriate.
There is no such enchanting sunset
for miles around.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t always that,” in his dry humorous
way. “And it <em>is</em> always round.”</p>

<p>“Then mine shall be its holiday name, a kind
of golden remembrance.”</p>

<p>“It is beautiful;” Miss Churchill said with
deep feeling. “Miss Fanny, your father preached
a good sermon last Sunday morning, about our
longing for loveliness and grandeur which was
far away, and not enjoying that right beside us,
and our desiring to do some great thing, waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
years for the opportunity, when we might have
made our lives rich with the small daily deeds
that are at our very finger ends. And how
many of us long for Italy when we have clear
skies and glowing sunsets at home that we know
nothing about!”</p>

<p>“Because such lives are crowded full to repletion.
I sometimes wonder if we do not have
too much instead of not enough? I find a large
world right around here, because I can’t get out
comfortably to any larger one.”</p>

<p>“And because you see the beauty in every
thing,” returned Fanny softly. “It’s just like
daily bread, the now, and here. We need not
starve to-day because of a famine coming a
hundred years hence.”</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill raised his grave eyes and smiled,
just a little. They moved on quietly again, the
wide glory of the twilight heavens falling gently
over, clasping hands with the indistinct outlines
of the beautiful earth. The creek went rippling
and winding around, making a pleasant stir, and
the insects began to chirp in low tones as if
not quite sure the night was coming.</p>

<p>“What a delightful day! Though I have not
done half the things that I meant to,” said Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Lucy as they were nearing home. “We were to
look over those Russian views this afternoon,
and I was to show you my sketches. It is all
Winthrop’s fault. We shall have to take the
day over again, Fanny.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say that I am sorry I came, having
a high regard for the truth. But then I <em>am</em>
going; and the world will still last;” he returned.</p>

<p>“That must be our comfort.”</p>

<p>“I wish you and your sister would come over
soon, not merely to tea, but to spend a good
long afternoon;” said Miss Churchill. “And I
have a basket of flowers to send home with
you.”</p>

<p>“Does Miss Endicott go alone?” Winthrop
asked.</p>

<p>“In the carriage—unless you should have
the politeness to accompany her,” answered Miss
Churchill rather inconsequently.</p>

<p>“With pleasure—if Aunt Lucy can spare me.”</p>

<p>“I shall march straight to bed, you saucy
boy.”</p>

<p>The ladies were helped out. Fanny thought
she had better keep right on. Miss Churchill
brought a great basket of fragrance and beauty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
and said she would send the parcel over the
next morning, “that is if you are quite sure
that you will not feel patronized,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“No,” returned Fan frankly. “Rose and I
will be most grateful.”</p>

<p>Lucy kissed her good by. Miss Churchill’s
farewell was a little more formal, but full of
sweet cordiality. The coachman sprang up in
his seat and turned the horses slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill assisted Lucy up the steps.
“What a pretty behaved girl,” he said. “She
is bright and pleasant without being bold or
underbred. And she enjoys everything so thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“She makes one feel young again. She fairly
gives of her own abundant youth.”</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the two rode home together.
There was no moon, but the stars were out by
thousands, shining in all their glory. They
talked of the beauty of the night, of the improvements
in the town, and he asked what
was going on in the way of entertainment. This
was how Fan came to mention the picnic, and
Mr. Ogden was interested in it immediately.</p>

<p>Nelly and the elders were sitting in the wide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
airy hall with the lamp in the back part, making
a golden twilight within. Fan set her
flowers in the midst, and all the air was sweet.</p>

<p>Such a lovely day as it had been! The talk
and visiting, the dinner and tea, the two rides,—Miss
Churchill and Miss Lucy—the kindly
messages to mamma,—the invitation to tea, and
best of all, the thought about papa’s sermon.
Fan had a way of bringing something home from
every place for every body. It was as good as
going yourself.</p>

<p>“So papa, dear, it wasn’t my fascination altogether,
but a little pinch of your good seed. It
springs up occasionally where you do not expect
it. And now tell me what you have been
doing?”</p>

<p>Our day had proved one of the unsatisfactory
days.</p>

<p>Mamma had gone out in the morning to make
some calls, and found Mrs. Day’s baby very
sick. Edith started from her nap in affright,
and while I went down to soothe her, Stuart
had tormented my patient into a fit of passion,
so that he had a headache and could eat no
dinner. Then there had been a steady stream
of visitors all the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t get much of your trimming done,”
I said to Fan, “but the picnic is not until
Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“And I can work like a Trojan to-morrow.
Oh! mamma and Rose, there is something else—I
hope you will think I have acted rightly
about it.”</p>

<p>Then followed an account of the gift.</p>

<p>“I do not see how you could well have done
differently. Miss Churchill was very kind and
delicate.”</p>

<p>“Fan,” exclaimed papa as if waking out of a
dream—“I think I <em>do</em> see the good seed. But
some things are best to let grow by themselves.
If you poke about the roots and snip off and
tie up, you don’t get half the bloom and beauty.
People like the Churchills might bring forth
so much fruit. Perhaps it will come. The same
God who made the gourd, made the century
plant. Mother, couldn’t we have a quiet little
hymn?”</p>

<p>It was a trick he had when there was any
special thing on his mind. Mamma’s soft playing
seemed to smooth out the tangles.</p>

<p>We sang with her, and then kissed each other
good night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>The next day was ever so much better. Mamma
had talked to both of the boys, and I think
Louis <em>did</em> try to be patient and pleasant. Fan
came in and helped entertain him while we both
sewed. The dresses were sent with a note from
Miss Churchill, and mamma thought them extremely
pretty. We finished Fan’s pique all
but the button holes, by night.</p>

<p>Just after tea Mrs. Day sent over. Mamma
answered the summons and staid until ten, then
she came home to tell us that the poor little
life had gone out here, to blossom brighter
elsewhere. She had washed it and dressed it
for the last time, with her tender hands. Mrs.
Downs had come to stay all night, for Mrs.
Day was in violent hysterics.</p>

<p>Early Sunday morning the baby was buried.
Three little graves in a row, and only Betty and
Jem left. I stopped in Church just a moment
to give thanks on my knees that our little flock
were all alive and well.</p>

<p>“I wonder how you can take such an interest
in everybody?” Louis said as I sat with
him awhile that evening. “In one way your
father and mother have a duty towards all in
the parish, but—I don’t know as I can <em>quite</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
explain,—you seem to make their troubles and
their pleasures your very own. And some of
the people must be—very common, and quite
ignorant—excuse me, but it is so all over the
world.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the secret of <em>true</em> sympathy? If
you were in great sorrow and went to a friend,
would you not like to have the comfort adapted
to your nature, and wants? The other would
be asking for bread and receiving a stone.”</p>

<p>“It is very good of course, really noble. But
it would fret me to do favors for people who
did not interest me one bit. Now I can understand
your sister’s enjoying her day at the
Churchills, even if she was asked partly to entertain
an invalid. They were refined, agreeable
people. But that she should give up going to
ride with Miss Fairlie yesterday afternoon, to
make a bonnet for that woman who lost her
baby, and who wasn’t a bit thankful—”</p>

<p>“She <em>was</em> thankful,” I interposed.</p>

<p>“Stuart went with your sister, and he said
she found fault because it wasn’t the right shape,
and because there was ribbon used instead of
crape. I should have smashed up the thing and
thrown it into the fire, and told her to suit
herself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>I laughed a little, the remark was so characteristic.</p>

<p>“We get used to people’s ways after a while,”
I said. “Mrs. Day never is <em>quite</em> satisfied. If
a thing had only been a little different. And
very likely next week she will show the bonnet
to some neighbor and praise Fanny’s thoughtfulness
and taste. You see no one happened to
think of a bonnet until it was pretty late.”</p>

<p>“But why could she not have been thankful
on the spot? It was ungracious, to say the
least.”</p>

<p>“That is her way.”</p>

<p>“I’d get her out of it, or I wouldn’t do any
favors for her.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if <em>we</em> are always thankful on the
spot, and when the favor doesn’t <em>quite</em> suit us?”</p>

<p>There was a silence of some moments, then
he said in a low tone: “Do you mean me,
Miss Endicott?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not quite as impolite as that. I
made my remark in a general sense.”</p>

<p>“Suppose some one gave you an article that
you did not want?”</p>

<p>“If it was from an equal, and I could decline
it, granting that it was perfectly useless, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
should do so. But an inferior, or a poorer person,
who might have taken a great deal of pains,
deserves more consideration.”</p>

<p>“Is it not deceitful to allow them to think
they have conferred a benefit upon you?”</p>

<p>“I do not look at it in that light. This person
intended a kindness, and I take it at his or
her appraisal. I am obliged for the labor and
love that went into it, the thought prompting it.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” after a silence.</p>

<p>“And doesn’t that make the good fellowship
of the world? When equals exchange small
courtesies there is no special merit in it. No
self-sacrifice is required, no lifting up of any
one, or no going down. The world at large is
no better or stronger for the example. It is
when we go out of ourselves, make our own
patience and generosity and sympathy larger,
that we begin to enjoy the giving and doing.”</p>

<p>“But you can not really like poor, ignorant
people?”</p>

<p>“Better sometimes than I can like rich, ignorant
people. When you walk along the roadside
you enjoy the clover blooms, the common
daisies and mallows, and every flowering weed.
The way gives you its very best. These blossoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
laugh and nod and twinkle in the glad
sunshine, and you are joyous with them. But
if a friend who had a large garden and gardeners
in abundance asked you to come, and took you
through weedy grass-grown paths, and gathered
for you a bunch of field flowers, you would not
feel so much obliged.”</p>

<p>“Why no.”</p>

<p>“It is the giving of one’s best. It may also
mean the ability to appreciate, when another
gives of the best he has.”</p>

<p>“But <em>can</em> you like the work? Pardon me,
but it has always seemed to me a hint of a second
or third rate mind when one can be happy
with such common pleasures. There, no doubt
I have offended you.”</p>

<p>“If we were always looking for our own perfect
satisfaction, it would not be. But, ‘No
man liveth to himself,’ only.”</p>

<p>“Miss Endicott, I don’t wonder you like my
brother Stephen. After all,” rather doubtfully,
“isn’t there a good deal of cant preached?”</p>

<p>“Only believe. All the rest will be added,”
I said hurriedly.</p>

<p>The church bell was ringing its middle peal.
There was a long pause then it took up a sweet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and rather rapid jangle, subsiding into the slow
swells of tender melody. We always called it
the middle peal and began to get ready, as that
gave us just time to go to church. I rose now,
and uttered a pleasant good night.</p>

<p>“Say a little prayer for me, if you don’t think
I am too wicked;” he murmured faintly, turning
his face away.</p>

<p>How peculiar he was! When I thought him
softening, he was always sure to draw back into
his shell again, and his confidences invariably
came unexpectedly. Then too, they puzzled me,
I was not fit to cope with them. They seemed
to jar and jangle with the every day smoothness
of my own life.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden was at church alone that evening,
and though the Maynard girls were there, walked
home in our circle. I was going to stay with
Fannie, but Dick Fairlie was on the other side
of her, and George and Allie West swallowed
me up in the narrow path.</p>

<p>“I am coming in to-morrow morning to tell
you of the picnic plans,” said Allie as we were
about to separate.</p>

<p>“Can’t I come in the evening and hear?”
asked Mr. Ogden. “Or am I the man on the
other side?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“No indeed,” spoke up Allie, “we shall be
glad to have you. I will leave a special
message.”</p>

<p>They were a little acquainted with him, having
met him at the Maynards the summer before.
The young ladies of that family had declined
participating in the affair.</p>

<p>We heard all the plans on Monday morn.
They were to go out to Longmeadow in wagons
and carriages, taking refreshments and conveniences.
There was just a nice party. “The kind
of people who harmonize,” said Miss West. “I
never can endure Tom, Dick and Harry—everybody
and his wife.”</p>

<p>“Of course you wouldn’t want everybody in
a small party,” I returned.</p>

<p>“I wish you were going, Rose.”</p>

<p>“The Sunday School picnic comes the week
after. I could not go to both.”</p>

<p>“This will be ever so much nicer.”</p>

<p>“O, I am not sure. There will be more enjoyment
at that, because there will be so many
more to enjoy everything.”</p>

<p>“Your way of thinking! Well, if I was a
clergyman’s daughter I should have to go I suppose.
I am glad that I can choose my pleasures.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Fanny Endicott, if Mr. Ogden calls this
evening give him my compliments and a special
invitation.”</p>

<p>Fan colored and made some laughing retort.</p>

<p>He did come over with a message from his
aunts, asking us to tea on Thursday evening if
it was convenient. Then he wanted to know
about the picnic, and said that he might be expected,
sure.</p>

<p>Dick and Kate came over for Fanny. Mrs.
Fairlie was in the wagon and leaned out to make
some inquiries about Mr. Duncan. Stuart had
taken a knapsack and started on foot.</p>

<p>I went a few steps further on to fasten up a
spray of clematis. Dick followed.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you couldn’t have gone
too;” he said rather crossly.</p>

<p>“Should I have added so very much?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that grand chap of the Churchills’
will be there?” he went on without noticing
my remark.</p>

<p>“Yes. He was invited by Allie West, you
know.”</p>

<p>He snapped off a piece of honeysuckle. What
was the matter with him this morning?</p>

<p>Fan came down in her new pique dress, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
broad sun hat trimmed with light blue, and her
white parasol lined with the same tint. She
was pretty and stylish enough for any lady’s
daughter. Kate was in a silvery, much be-ruffled
poplin, and a jaunty round hat that scarcely
shaded her eyes.</p>

<p>Louis was considerably improved that day.
He walked into the next room, arranged some
flowers that I brought him, and was quite cheerful.
He wanted very much to go down stairs,
but mamma thought he had better not, so he
acquiesced pleasantly.</p>

<p>“If you are no worse to-morrow you may try
it,” she promised.</p>

<p>Fan had a royal time, though she declared
she was half tired to death.</p>

<p>Up in our room she told me all the particulars.</p>

<p>“Everything was just lovely! Servants to do
the work, make fires and coffee, and spread tables,
while we sat, or walked in the shade, or rambled
through the woods. We had the violins
and quadrilles and gallops and laughing, and
may be a little flirting. It was absolutely funny
to see young Ogden.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fan, I hope you didn’t—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“My dear little grandmother, I am afraid I
did, just the least bit. You see Kate and Allie
West tried so hard for Mr. Ogden, and he kept
by my side <em>so</em> easily. I had only to look. And
Dick Fairlie was like a bear. Something has
vexed him.”</p>

<p>“I thought he was cross this morning. But,
oh, Fan, I wouldn’t have you do any thing to—to
displease the Churchills.”</p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t, honestly Rose. This is
nothing beyond summer pastime. Why can’t we
all be bright and nice and social? It is a humbug
to think of everybody’s falling in love. I
don’t believe young people <em>would</em> think of it,
only some one is afraid and speaks before the
time, making a tangle of it all. I do not expect
any one to fall in love with me—at present.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Excitements</span> and engagements multiplied
with us. One and another had
visitors from the city and we were sent
for to tea or to spend the evening. Stuart was
asked every where as well. Louis came down
the next day and sat in the hall with us, where
we were sewing as usual. Then on Thursday
we went to the Churchills. They sent the carriage
over early, before we were ready, indeed.
Louis eyed the soft cushions wistfully.</p>

<p>“Oh,” I spoke out before I thought, but I
was glad an instant after,—“if you would spare
a few moments,—if you would take an invalid
a short drive—”</p>

<p>“With pleasure Miss. The sick young man,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and I ran to beg papa to help him
out. Louis was delighted, I could see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>They drove down the quiet street, where the
trees met overhead. Quaint and old fashioned,
with great gardens, many of the houses being
owned by widows, or elderly people whose children
were married and gone. Less than a
quarter of a mile away the road curved, and in
this little three-cornered space stood our pretty
gray stone church, the shady side covered with ivy.</p>

<p>“It was delightful;” said Louis on his return.
“But I never thought of the great liberty we
were taking.”</p>

<p>“Do not fret about that,” I made answer gaily.
“Be just as good as you can, while I am gone.”</p>

<p>I was glad they had asked no one else at the
Churchills. The Maynards had been over the
day before. Miss Churchill received us very
cordially. I explained what I had done, and
made a small apology.</p>

<p>“My dear child, I am pleased that you thought
of it,” returned Miss Churchill. “Why, we
might send over almost every day. I am glad
he is improving so nicely.”</p>

<p>“It would be a charitable work for me, Aunt
Esther. Such a little satisfies Aunt Lu that I
do not keep half busy,” said Mr. Ogden.</p>

<p>“I never knew you to have such an industrious
fit;” replied his aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“But I have been in business for a year you
see, and have ceased to be an idler;” and he made
a comical face.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy came down soon after. Then we
had a nice cordial time talking about books and
looking over pictures.</p>

<p>Sometimes two or three voices sounded at once,
not from any ill breeding, but because we all
had so much to say. Then we would laugh and
subside, and begin again. I almost wondered
how we dared feel so much at home, and utter
our every day thoughts unreservedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill joined us, and the conversation,
asking about church matters, and if we were
going to take the Sunday School to the cascade
again? Were there many sick in the parish?</p>

<p>“Not very many for this season of the year,”
I made answer.</p>

<p>“Our town is about as healthy as any location
I know. Why people must be running off to
watering places and leaving comfortable houses,
I can not understand.”</p>

<p>“The grand thing is change. Most of us do
get tired of running along in one groove.”</p>

<p>“Why Esther! I thought you considered the
doctrine of change a great heresy!” and Mr.
Churchill looked surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“I have been thinking lately that we might
make our lives too narrow, too self-satisfying.
So if we get outside we may have our ideas
broadened, and find something new to do, or if
we are dissatisfied with our surroundings, we
may come back quite content.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go any where?”</p>

<p>“Not just now.”</p>

<p>Fan and Lucy had been talking over the picnic.</p>

<p>“Can’t we drive there in the afternoon?” she
asked of her brother, “I should like to see a
crowd of happy children.”</p>

<p>“Are you going, Winthrop?”</p>

<p>“I expect to be field marshal. Miss Endicott
has engaged my services at an enormous salary.
You will be able to tell me by a blue ribbon
around my left arm, and a primrose in the lappel
of my coat. I am to see that the rear guard is
prompt at dinner.”</p>

<p>He looked at me very soberly, and the others
glanced in the same direction. I could not help
blushing to the roots of my hair, and exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Why Mr. Ogden!”</p>

<p>“Aunt Lucy will tell you that I have a great
deal of executive ability.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>The tea-table was exquisite as usual. Afterward
we had music, Fan and I singing duets,
or Mr. Ogden joining us with a very promising
tenor voice.</p>

<p>“Can we not all sing?” asked Fanny presently.
“Let me play some familiar hymns.”</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill came and stood behind her
watching the graceful fingers that dropped such
soft, sweet notes. As if he could not resist he
added his bass voice, and then we had quite a
choir.</p>

<p>“Young ladies, you have given me an exceedingly
pleasant evening;” he said as we were
preparing to leave. “I hope it may soon be
repeated.”</p>

<p>Winthrop and Fanny laughed at each other
all the way home. They were not a bit sentimental,
and I felt quite relieved. Since the
Churchills were so cordial about it, why should
I worry?</p>

<p>He came over the next morning with the
barouche and two horses to take out Mr. Duncan.</p>

<p>“You didn’t ask such a favor for me?” and
Louis’ eyes almost flashed.</p>

<p>“I did not ask anything, or even hint. Why
can you not go and enjoy it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t choose to be patronized.”</p>

<p>“I think this was Mr. Ogden’s own planning.
You will like him I am sure. Oh please go,”
I entreated.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Winthrop had been admiring
the baby and bantering some one else to fill
up the carriage. Oddly enough mamma consented
to take Edith. When Louis heard that
he made no further objection.</p>

<p>The result of this was that Winthrop came
back and staid to dinner. We were all going
to the Fairlie’s to tea and croquet. And Fan
absolutely sent him home or I believe he would
have staid until we started.</p>

<p>Mamma liked him. Stuart pronounced him
jolly, but Louis withheld his verdict. I must
confess that I admired him ever so much. You
could get on with him so nicely.</p>

<p>I was very glad that Fan did not monopolize
him during the evening. Dick appeared quite
elated with her notice of him. It was moonlight
and we walked home together, but somehow
then Dick fell to my share.</p>

<p>The next week we hardly had a moment to
breathe. What with our engagements and getting
everything in train for the picnic we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
as busy as bees. The aristocratic part seldom
joined us, but papa always obeyed the scriptural
injunction. The lame, and the halt, and the
blind were hunted up, the whimsical old people
who would not go without a special invitation,
the poor who were sure they had nothing to
wear, and the children who were always ready,
but needed getting in order.</p>

<p>Mamma remained behind with baby and Louis.
I was to act for her as well as I could. The
stronger portion of the community were to meet
on the church green and march in regular order.
Fan had beguiled Dick Fairlie into taking Jennie
Ryder and her mother, who was quite disabled
from a stroke of paralysis two years before.
All the others were to go in wagons or stages
or wheel-barrows, she said.</p>

<p>Winthrop came over and helped us manage
the children. At nine we took up our line of
march under the shady trees. There was a
shorter way in the sun, but we had time enough.
This road wound round the hilly district, crossed
the river once, and then seemed to lose itself in
the woods. At least there was the hill and the
trees on one side. Here a craggy declivity stood
out bold and brown amid the waving green,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
ferns and wild flowers grew in the clefts, or
shrubs with precarious footing. A spur of the
creek ran along the height, and presently began
to find its way down through a sort of
sloping river, purling over rocks and stones and
fallen trees, and in two places pouring down a
precipitous pathway, making very pretty falls,
the larger one at least ten feet high. Then it
ran off and joined the river.</p>

<p>There was one lovely nook, though art had
assisted nature here. A clearing had been made
years ago, and now the turf of clover and grass
was like velvet.</p>

<p>It was a small basin between the mountains.
Down one side of it came the cascade, wandering
off through the woods in curves that made a
picturesque way. The place was used considerably
for pleasure parties, and kept in tolerable
order. The committee had been down the day
before, put up swings, made some long tables and
seats, and given the place quite a homelike air.</p>

<p>The walk was beautiful with varied scenery,
fresh, crisp air, and clearest of skies. Mr. Ogden
made acquaintance with Mr. Trafton, our superintendent,
in about five minutes, and they marshalled
the children in a jolly fashion. All heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
baskets and bundles were put in a great farm
wagon, and we had nothing to do but march
along triumphantly to the carol of the birds.</p>

<p>The youngsters were wild, of course. They
shouted at a little gray squirrel which ran along
the path, they gave sundry shrill whistles that
exceeded the birds, they laughed and chattered,
stepped out of line to gather wild flowers or pick
up some uncommon pebble, beginning their day’s
pleasure at the very outset. But papa did not
care. Indeed he was as merry as any of them.</p>

<p>I thought several times how Stephen Duncan
would have liked it. I wondered what should
have brought him so plainly before my mind on
this particular day!</p>

<p>Through winding ways we trooped. Over
beyond there were broad meadows and waving
corn-fields, scattered farm buildings and cottages,
with a bit of road, gleaming dusty white in the
sunshine, the river broadening into lakes or
bending abruptly; and nearer, the changing
glooms and shadows, the points of the hills in
blue and purple and bronze. All the air was so
clear and sweet, it sent the rushes of warm blood
to heart and brain, and then to very finger
ends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>The infantry, as Winthrop called it, reached
the ground a long while first. We had to disband
and the children ran around as if they had
never seen a bit of country before. Shawls and
baskets were stowed in out-of-the-way corners
or suspended from trees. Some of the hardier
boys pulled off shoes and stockings, preparatory
to having a good time. As for us elders, we
began to straighten out our affairs and set up
for house-keeping. There were so many lovely
people. Miss Oldways,—who taught the bible-class
of larger girls,—in her soft, pearl gray dress,
and ribbon of the same shade on her bonnet,
with a bit of pale blue inside. She was always
so sweet and lady-like. She and her widowed
sister, Mrs. Bromley, kept a little thread and
needle store in the village, and, though they
were business women, I did not see that it detracted
in the least from their refinement.</p>

<p>Annie and Chris Fellows were with us, and
Mrs. Elsden, though she had four children in
the Sunday School, but I think she would have
enjoyed herself any way. Mrs. Fairlie and Kate
had gone to the sea-shore the day before, with
the Wests and some others. Then there were
Mothers and Aunts of the children, and several
of the farmer families near by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>We had stowed our luggage in a cool, shady
place and sent the wagon home when the caravan
arrived. Old ladies who could not have
walked, but were in holiday white apron and
kerchief, or best gingham dress, and some with
their knitting. We placed shawls on the mossy
rocks or benches, and seated them.</p>

<p>“Here is your precious cargo,” said Dick to
Fannie. “Come and welcome them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Ryder, I am so glad you <em>could</em>
come.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t if it had not been for you, dear.
You are always thinking of something pleasant.
I was so surprised when Dick told me—”</p>

<p>He was Dick to almost everybody, for his
father was a plain, sociable farmer, and the son
had grown up with the village boys. It was a
great mortification to Mrs. Fairlie that he did
not want to go to college and liked farming.
But then Kate kindly took “cultivation” enough
for two.</p>

<p>“What will you do with her?” asked Dick,
lifting her out in his strong arms.</p>

<p>“Right here. O Jennie!” and she went on
making a soft corner.</p>

<p>Dick put Mrs. Ryder in it. The neighbors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
crowded round, glad to see her out. A pale,
sweet, motherly looking woman, who had been
very handsome in her day, and now her cordial
thankfulness was good to behold.</p>

<p>“You are just splendid;” Fan whispered to
Dick.</p>

<p>We all liked Jennie Ryder ever so much, and
felt a peculiar interest in her, beside. Two
years ago,—or it would be in September,—after
Jennie had graduated with honors she obtained
a situation in an excellent school some twenty
miles away, where she could only come home
every Friday, but then the salary was too good to
be declined. Just after she had taught two
months, the stroke had fallen upon her mother.
A cousin who had always lived with them was
taken ill with a fever and died. For weeks Mrs.
Ryder lay between life and death. Jennie was
compelled to relinquish her school. It was a
sore disappointment, for she loved teaching. But
by spring Mrs. Ryder had partially recovered her
health, yet her limbs were well nigh useless.
She would hobble around a little with crutches,
but Jennie knew that it would never do to leave
her alone.</p>

<p>They owned a small cottage and garden, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
the sickness had made sad inroads in the little
fortune. Jennie felt compelled to earn something
at home, so she bought a sewing machine
and did fine work. I suppose every town or
village thinks it <em>must</em> draw a line somewhere.
There were the exclusive West Side people,
who only expected to exchange calls with each
other, there were the rich people who had been
poor thirty or forty years ago, and then there
was the circle who wanted to get on and up,
by pushing others down and clinging to the
skirts of those just above them. Somehow Jennie
Ryder was pushed down. The richer girls
who were at the Academy with her dropped
her by degrees when she sewed for their mothers.
One and another left off inviting her out
to little sociables, or croquet. I think she felt
it keenly, but she made no complaint.</p>

<p>She had so many pretty refined ways and
accomplishments. If she had been in a city she
could have made them useful, but here all the
places were filled. She painted in water colors,
drew in crayons, that were almost equal to chromos,
made moss baskets and ferneries and picture
scrap-books, and had their house looking like a
little fairy nest. And she was so sunny and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
cheery, and really charming when her true self
had a chance to peep out from the fence that
circumstances and ignorant people built about
her.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said glancing around; “it is like
a bit of heaven framed in, isn’t it? just look at
the sky over head and the tree tops and mountain
tops holding it up, as it were. And a whole
long, lovely day! I did not expect on Sunday
that I <em>could</em> come.”</p>

<p>“It’s the daily bread for this day;” said papa
softly, as he was shaking hands with her mother.</p>

<p>“And cake and cream and fruit off of the
twelve trees. And the seventy palms with their
shade and beauty.”</p>

<p>“You have brought some sunshine,—you seldom
go empty-handed, Jennie,” said papa.</p>

<p>Dick turned and looked at her just then. She
had such a clear, sweet, tender expression, the
nameless something better than beauty. A slender,
graceful figure, white and peachy-pink tints
with brown hair and eyes. Her dress was white
and a marvel of workmanship, with its bias
tucking and straight tucking and bands of embroidery
that she had done herself. Fan once
quoted her, but mamma reminded her that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
were seven of us, and that tucks must be divided
by that number.</p>

<p>“And I am going to have a splendid time.
Mother, here is your book. Are you quite comfortable?
If you don’t mind, I will take a
ramble with the girls. You and Mrs. Conklin
can have a nice talk.”</p>

<p>“No dear, go on.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Conklin had taken out her knitting.
She was from one of the farms over the river,
a healthy, happy, rosy-cheeked grandmother, her
fingers flying fondly in and out of the tiny red
clouded stocking.</p>

<p>“Where will you go first?” asked Dick of
the group of girls.</p>

<p>“To the Cascade,” replied Mr. Ogden.</p>

<p>“You are not girls,” said Fan saucily.</p>

<p>“But you know you wouldn’t that one of us
were left behind;” he quoted sentimentally.</p>

<p>“Don’t flatter yourself too much. Modesty is
becoming to young people.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect to find the old ones sitting
on the steps of time, with faces grimly uncovered?”</p>

<p>They all laughed. Fan took Jennie Ryder’s
arm, and Dick filled up the path beside them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
so Winthrop fell back with me. Stuart was right
behind with the prettiest girl he could find, as
usual. On we started, but ere we had reached
the first ascent we saw numerous followers in
our wake.</p>

<p>“It is like a picture,” exclaimed Winthrop.
“Or better still, a series of pictures. Oh, look
at this moss! and these tiny ferns!”</p>

<p>They all stopped. How beautiful it was in
this wide, glowing, redundant life, the trailing
riotous vines, the long streamers of last year’s
Aaron’s beard, the rustling of the leaves and
the rippling, tinkling sound of the water.</p>

<p>“How curious;” said Jennie. “That is a
walking fern.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you know it?” and Winthrop glanced up
in a pleased fashion.</p>

<p>“I have a fern bed at home. I like them so
much. And these grow in such a peculiar manner.”</p>

<p>“And she has the cunningest winter ferneries
that you ever saw, Mr. Ogden,” declared
Fan.</p>

<p>“I like them too. They always give me a
peculiar sensation of the quiet and shade in
which they grew. They are like the Quakers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
never surprising you by any gaudy freaks of blossoming.
Oh, were any of you here a month ago?”</p>

<p>“I came for rhododendrons one day;” Jennie
answered.</p>

<p>“That was what entered my mind. What
crowds and crowds of trees! I am generally here
in August, so I miss that. How perfectly glorious
they must be. What colors?”</p>

<p>“Pure white and pale, blossomy pink.”</p>

<p>“Those are my favorites. I sometimes think
I was meant for a country life. I like the growing
and blossoming, the ripening and the fruit.
Autumn rounds everything so perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick, “there is always a great
richness in Autumn. The smells of the drying
fields, of the stacked corn, the apples and pears
and grapes. And the leaves all aglow, the chestnuts
full of yellow burrs. You ought to come
then, Mr. Ogden!”</p>

<p>“I believe I will. Can we all go nutting?
That is after the frosts, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes, late in October.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look!”</p>

<p>We had been going on for a few moments,
now we paused again. It was so all the way
up. Something to see and to feel, to pause and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
drink in with all one’s soul. Here a rock sculptured
and set as if by an artist hand. Richest
moss, great, feathery fronds, pellucid waters,
breaks of sunshine, and haunts of deep gloom.
Now we were serious, then we laughed gaily at
some quick jest. It takes so little to amuse
when one is young and happy.</p>

<p>We passed the stream at length and went on
to the mountain-top. What a fair outlying
prospect! There was the village below, the
church spires, some tall factory chimneys, and
beyond it all mountains again. I thought of
the hills standing about Jerusalem, and the Lord
everywhere, standing about his people.</p>

<p>“O,” exclaimed Fan at length, “we must go
back, who will get our dinner?”</p>

<p>“Who will eat it? is a subject for our more
serious consideration;” said Winthrop.</p>

<p>“And if—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘When we get there</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The cupboard is bare?’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That would be a dire misfortune. By the
time we reach the bottom again, we shall be as
hungry as bears.”</p>

<p>“You might comfort yourself like the old man
of Kilkenny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“How was that?” inquired Winthrop.</p>

<p>Stuart’s eyes twinkled with their fun-loving
light as he began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There was an old man of Kilkenny.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Who never had more than a penny.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">He spent all that money in onions and honey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">This wayward old man of Kilkenny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They all laughed heartily. We began our
descent but were changed about somehow. Every
body helped the one who came to hand. Now
it was Dick, then Mr. Ogden or Stuart. We
slipped and scrambled and uttered small shrieks,
making the way very lively.</p>

<p>“See here!” exclaimed Winthrop—“a wild
rose and buds, I think them so especially beautiful.
Who is queen of the May to be crowned?”</p>

<p>“You are too late;” laughed Fan, “May has
gone.”</p>

<p>“Queen of Midsummer, then. Miss Endicott
accept this late treasure. Let it blossom and
wither on your heart—sweets to the sweet.”</p>

<p>This was to Fan. Her blue eyes laughed
saucily.</p>

<p>“The sweet in both cases being about alike,”
she made answer.</p>

<p>He gave it to her in a mock sentimental
fashion just as his speech had been. She fastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
it in the bosom of her dress, making a
sweeping courtesy.</p>

<p>A strange flash glowed over Dick Fairlie’s
face. I do not think any one else observed it,
but it sent my heart up to my throat in a
moment. I understood with a kind of secret
sense that it was both love and jealousy. Then
I glanced at gay laughing Fan. Did she mistrust?</p>

<p>I felt strangely, sadly wise, as if in five
minutes I had grown years older. A thing like
this coming into our very midst! Well, among
so many girls there would probably be one or
two marriages, and who more likely than winsome,
beguiling Fanny.</p>

<p>In the valley they were at work. A fire had
been kindled and a great tea kettle was swinging
in the blaze. Baskets were being unpacked.
Table cloths and dishes laid out, and everybody
talked at once.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said papa, “I have been looking for
you. Miss Oldways wants you to help with the
table. Where are Daisy, Lil and Tim?”</p>

<p>“Nelly promised to keep watch and ward to-day;”
and with that I shook out my large
white kitchen apron which nearly covered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
skirt of my dress, and went to work in good
earnest.</p>

<p>“I suppose we <em>do</em> enjoy things better when
we have to work for them,” said old Mrs.
Granby. “We rush round helter skelter, get
our puddings shaken up and our nice crisp pie-crust
jammed and broken, and eat biscuits that
have been spread for three hours, and a bite of
cold meat, and after we have gone home to
think it over it seems ever so much better than
a great dinner.”</p>

<p>“The good-fellowship adds. I never go on a
picnic but I think of the Apostles having all
things in common;” returned Miss Oldways.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said papa, “they gave of their time
and interest, and love, as well. It was not
merely a little money. They brought in the
whole family and bestowed with the open-handed
tenderness that blesses the giver as well.”</p>

<p>I heard snatches of their talk as I ran onward,
and snatches of other talk. Here were sandwiches
dripping with jelly, that had somehow
been upturned in the basket.</p>

<p>“Jelly is fashionable with meats,” suggested
some one.</p>

<p>“There! I haven’t put in a single spoon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
And I took the trouble to tie red threads
around each handle, then left them on the dresser.
That was smart!”</p>

<p>“We will reverse the order of things and have
two creams with one spoon, the second to wait
until the first is served.”</p>

<p>“Is every plate used? Let’s count. All the
elders must come first—thirty, thirty-one, and
the young girls wait on the table—thirty-eight—it
is but fair that their mothers should have the
best once in a while. Sixty-one! Now ring the
bell.”</p>

<p>They filled up the first table, putting a little
child in here and there. The tea and coffee
steamed out their appetizing fragrance, and as
we had no vases, we placed mounds of fern,
grasses and wild flowers on the table. Every
body ate and drank and had a good time. The
dishes were washed, wiped, and put on again,
the children summoned, and after a while all
had been feasted. Then there was a general
clearing away, except at one end of the long
table where the fragments were collected for
those who might get hungry by and by.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">After</span> the eating and drinking, the elders
gathered for a sociable chat. It was as
good as old-fashioned country visiting.
Modern calls seem to have carried away the
charm of social intercourse. After you have
staid five minutes you begin to think you must
go. You cannot stop to tell this or that bit of
pleasantness, or get near to each other. But
there was no hurry here. Phases of religious
experiences were compared in a homely way,
mixed up with the turning of a gown, or buying
of a new carpet. With others grace and
gardening went hand in hand. Such magnificent
clove pinks, great double luscious blossoms!—blue
salvias that were quite a rarity—ivies,
geraniums—sick neighbors who enjoyed them—odd
enough snatches where one couldn’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>Well, is it not the true living after all? Is
religion the sacred Sunday thing that must be
laid by and not profaned by common every-day
uses? Did anyone ever hear of it wearing out?
When these people had exchanged thoughts on
trials and mercies, faith that could see, and
weak faith that stumbled, compared and comforted
each other, who shall say it was not as
good as a sermon? Why should we not help
to lift each other up in our common needs?—Great
things come to very few, only.</p>

<p>I lingered for quite a while, resting myself
and answering questions about mamma, baby
and Mr. Duncan. It was so dreamily pleasant.
The sun high over head had found our little
nook and was making it all alight with quivering
golden rays. Hill seemed to lapse into hill,
tree interlaced with tree, nook, corner and ravine
added their suggestive tender gloom. People
came and went, groups of children rushed in and
devoured plates of fragments. They played various
games, and at last settled to a tremendous
circle of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>“Where is your sister?” asked Winthrop, “I
have been hunting everywhere for her. Will
you not take a walk with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>We had not gone very far before the bell
rang.</p>

<p>“The children are to sing their carols now.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have heard them fifty times?”</p>

<p>“Fifty-one will not surfeit me. Besides, I
must look after my class.”</p>

<p>“O, bother! Look after me a little while. I
am going back to the city on Saturday, and I
shall not see you for ever so long. I actually
envy that dolt of a Duncan who is sick at your
house. I never met two girls that I liked so
well. I don’t see how there is any goodness
left for the parish.”</p>

<p>He uttered all this in a rather cross, aggrieved
tone which made it sound so comically I could
not forbear laughing.</p>

<p>“O, you don’t know—I wonder if I might
trust you with—a—secret?”</p>

<p>He flushed to the roots of his hair. An uncomfortable
chill went over me.</p>

<p>“There are your Aunts!” I said, glad to be
relieved from the sudden embarrassment.</p>

<p>The carriage came up through the opening.
Miss Lucy dressed in white and looking very
sweet. Papa went to speak to them.</p>

<p>The children were gathering from “near and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
from far.” We teachers “counted noses,” begged
the groups not to disperse, ran hither and thither,
and at last settled to the business before us.
I was so glad that Miss Churchill and Miss
Lucy had reached us in time for the singing.
What if dresses were a little limp and stained
and soiled, hats awry and curls blown in tangles,
there were hosts of happy faces and lightsome,
ringing voices.</p>

<p>Papa generally wrote a childish hymn for
special occasions and mamma arranged the music.
They sang that, then several Easter
Carols.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy beckoned me toward her.</p>

<p>“How delightful it is!” she exclaimed. “And
you’ve had a good time all day long. I wish
I was a little girl! Oh, they are not going to
stop? Please ask them to sing again. Would
Christmas carols be out of place?”</p>

<p>I mentioned it to papa who smiled in his sweet
fashion and acquiesced. We had the “Kings of
Orient,” “Wonderful Night,” and “Ring out
merry bells for Christmas.” How sweet those
young voices sounded on the summer air! I
was really proud of the children.</p>

<p>“Now,” began papa after the last echoes had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
dropped from the tree-tops, “we must form a
line for our homeward march. We have had a
pleasant day and enjoyed ourselves to the uttermost.
Let us thank God for this great blessing.”</p>

<p>They stood reverently until he dismissed them
with the benediction.</p>

<p>The wagons and carriages began to come in
and were filled. Some chose to walk home and
let others ride. Mr. Trafford started to form
the ranks again. Fan came up and we paused
to say a few words to the Churchills, then to
Mrs. Ryder who declared that everything had
been just delightful, and that she felt ten years
younger. Dick was very grave, I remarked,
and scarcely spoke.</p>

<p>The very last of the line was Fan and Mr.
Ogden. I gave them a quick glance but was
hurried on by the throng behind me, and occupied
with answering the childrens’ questions.
Yet I wondered a little what she had been about
since dinner.</p>

<p>We heard it all afterward, but it is fresher
just as it happened to her. She and Jennie
Ryder, and Annie and Chris Fellows went first
to gather ferns and mosses. Of course some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
the young men followed in their wake. When
their basket had been filled they strolled off two
and two, presently losing sight of each other.
The day gave its touch of grace and romance to
their lives. We all guessed that Mr. Hunter
cared for Annie Fellows, and were not much
surprised when we heard a little later, that they
had “made up their minds” during the ramble.</p>

<p>Fan and Dick strolled onward as well. Dick
was unusually silent.</p>

<p>“Shall we go back?” Fan asked softly by and
by.</p>

<p>“Go back!” and Dick looked surprised. “Not
unless you are tired of me.”</p>

<p>He seemed so down-hearted that Fan had not
the courage to confess even in her laughing way.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have not enjoyed yourself
very well. But you have given a great pleasure
to Mrs. Ryder—and Jennie could not have
come without her. She has to stay at home so
much.”</p>

<p>“She is a splendid girl,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Indeed she is. Dick, I have a bright idea!
Why couldn’t we when the evenings are a little
cooler, get up a surprise party for her? It
would be jolly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But you do not seem very much interested.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> interested in anything you like. Only
I was thinking;” and he paused to study her
face.</p>

<p>“How queer you are!” with an embarrassed
laugh.</p>

<p>“Am I? And you don’t like queerness—you
don’t like me?”</p>

<p>Fan began to pull a fern leaf to pieces. It
was an odd personal question, but it could not
mean anything. Still her heart beat strangely,
and her breath seemed to tangle as it came up.</p>

<p>“You know I like you of course,” in a sharp,
saucy way, flinging out her curls. “And you
are good and pleasant and clever. Don’t I ask
favors first of you?”</p>

<p>“You never ask—for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it is because it pleases me.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could do something for you, alone.”</p>

<p>He snapped off a dry twig and began to
break it into bits. Then he kicked a stone out
of the path, keeping his face away from her.</p>

<p>She experienced a peculiar embarrassment.
Where was the happy medium between warmth
and coolness? She liked the brotherly friendship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
they had fallen into. Was it friendship really?</p>

<p>“If I did want anything,—I should not hesitate—to
come to you.”</p>

<p>Then they walked on in uncomfortable silence.
It was very awkward. In the new light coming
to Fan, she felt there <em>was</em> something unsaid.
Was it best to get over it as rapidly as possible,
leave it behind?</p>

<p>“I think we must return. Papa may want
me.”</p>

<p>He turned reluctantly. She quickened her
pace at first.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry. The day will come to an end
soon enough. I should like it to last a week,
at least.”</p>

<p>“What an odd idea. We only want pleasant
days to last.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this pleasant to you?”</p>

<p>“Why—yes. All my days are pleasant for
that matter. But I thought it was beginning
to bore you.”</p>

<p>He did not answer for quite a while, then he
seemed to go far away from the subject.</p>

<p>“It’s been nice for you at the Churchills.”</p>

<p>“Well—yes. Though I don’t want you to
think I was pleased with the notice because
they are rich.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“I know that does not make any difference
with you.”</p>

<p>“But then for that matter your father is rich,
too. And there are only two children.”</p>

<p>“Yet I wish the home—was like yours.”</p>

<p>“With seven girls? You would have no comfort
of your life if you were the only boy among
them,” and Fan laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“I would not mind trying it. Or at least—”</p>

<p>“Be warned in time,” and Fan shook her
fore-finger threateningly.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he exclaimed, with a sudden vehemence
in his tone. “Only—I’d be contented
with one. Fanny, couldn’t you?—I mean—I
love you!”</p>

<p>It was all out then! Fan stood still and white
while he was scarlet and trembling. Both were
surprised with a deep solemn awe, as if amazed
to have reached such a point.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to tell you so soon. I had
hardly put it into shape myself. But when I saw
that Winthrop Ogden hanging round after you,
I knew it all then just like a flash. And why
shouldn’t it be? They have enough at home
without you. And it would be so sweet! I
should think of nothing but your happiness. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
dreamed it all out on the porch last night,
sitting alone with father.”</p>

<p>His eyes and voice were alike imploring, and
he had spoken so rapidly that it carried her
right along. Now she put up her hand with a
gesture of pain.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick, dear Dick, I am so sorry! I
never thought of this!”</p>

<p>“Well!” with a kind of manly assurance,
“think of it now. I will be patient. We can
ask your mother and see what she says.”</p>

<p>“Dick, I had better tell you just the truth.
I am sorry there is any need to say it. I like
you very much in the pleasant, sisterly fashion
that has grown up between us. I do not believe
it can ever be any different. So it is best not
to hope, not to plan—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fanny, I cannot help it. How could I
stop all at once?”</p>

<p>She was touched to the heart. What should
she do? The tears came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“I must have acted very wrongly to make
you care so much for me in this way. I can
never, never forgive myself.”</p>

<p>He could not bear to hear the woman he
loved blamed, and the tears conquered him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“It is nothing you have done, don’t think
that,” he said earnestly. “You can’t help being
sweet and pretty, any more than that bird up
there can help singing. And you can’t help
being just what I want. You have treated me
the same as you have others, that is, I mean
you never tried in any way to make me love
you. It just came. And if you will only try—”</p>

<p>“If I did try, Dick, I should be ashamed to
confess that I could not love so good, and tender,
and true a man as you are. Then, perhaps
I might marry you, not loving you the best,
which would be very, very wicked, and ruin
your happiness. Oh, Dick, forgive me and let
me be your sister or your friend, or else let me
go quite away. I am so sorry.”</p>

<p>They walked on until the sound of voices
reached them. “Please leave me here,” she
entreated falteringly.</p>

<p>“I’m a great blundering chap, I know. I
might have said it all better—”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the saying, it is the thing itself.—O,
Dick, don’t you see that if I had loved you,
one word would have been enough. I should be
too honest to tease or make excuses.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is so,” in a slow, pathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
way that made Fan think she was a miserable
wretch. “And you can’t help it, I know. I’ll
try to—leave matters as they were, to be a—brother.”</p>

<p>He swallowed over a great lump in his throat,
and turned away without another word. When
she found herself quite alone she threw her trembling
figure on the mossy tree-roots and sobbed
bitterly. The glad unconsciousness of girlhood
was over.</p>

<p>“If he were not so good,” she thought, “or
so rich, or so kind! If I <em>could</em> find some fault.
And that makes it appear all the worse in me.
Oh, papa, dear, what have I done? Why does
every one want to—?”</p>

<p>And then she knew it was the old, old story,
that had began way back in Eden-days. People
always <em>did</em>, and always would, and sometimes
there was a hitch and a snarl, and the thread
broke.</p>

<p>She heard the bell calling the children together,
so she rose, and went to the tiny brook
to bathe her face. But she felt so shame-faced
and cowardly that she did not dare join them
until the singing was done. Then Dick would
be putting Mrs. Ryder in his wagon, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
the others bustling about. No one would take
much notice of her.</p>

<p>“O, here you are, run-away!” said a bright,
rather imperious voice. “Your sister has been
worried to death about you. I thought I should
have to begin and search the mountains. Come
along. I shall not give you another chance to
go astray.”</p>

<p>With that Winthrop Ogden took possession
of her. The carriages began to move on. The
line was forming, and Mr. Endicott walked
down its length.</p>

<p>“I have Miss Fannie here, safe;” Mr. Ogden
said, with a confident nod.</p>

<p>Fan was so glad to escape observation that
she uttered not a word.</p>

<p>“My Uncle and Aunts are here waiting to
speak to you.”</p>

<p>She suffered herself to be led thither, listened
to the chat and answered again without understanding
a word.</p>

<p>They fell in the rear of the procession. Indeed
she hardly noticed how they lagged behind,
until the tramp of the feet had quite a distant
sound.</p>

<p>“Where were you all the afternoon?” Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Ogden asked. “Your sister and I started once
to find you.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” absently.</p>

<p>“Yes. We did not know but the bears
might have come out and eaten you up.”</p>

<p>“Hardly.”</p>

<p>“You were not alone?”</p>

<p>“No. We went for ferns. Jennie Ryder and
the rest.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ryder has been back this hour. She
and her mother went away with the very first—with
Mr. Fairlie.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” indifferently.</p>

<p>“Well, what were you doing?”</p>

<p>“I won’t be questioned, there!”</p>

<p>“You are sure you were not in mischief?”</p>

<p>No answer to this, and a long silence.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Obstinacy,” he began at length,
“I really am afraid something has occurred to
ruffle your temper.”</p>

<p>“I do not know as you are compelled to suffer
from it!” she returned, positively provoked.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I couldn’t leave you here in a
howling wilderness, with the others miles ahead.”</p>

<p>“You exaggerate. Suppose we walk on and
overtake them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“We <em>are</em> walking on.”</p>

<p>She was in no mood for badinage. Indeed,
her heart smote her bitterly for the pain she had
unwittingly caused. She was upbraiding herself
and trying to think where the first false step
had begun.</p>

<p>“Are you tired?” he asked presently in a
gentler tone.</p>

<p>“Not much. But a day like this always finds
one rather stupid at its close.”</p>

<p>“Were your mental exertions in the woods
very severe? Did you stop to analyze and classify
the ferns?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You must have found some delightful employment.”</p>

<p>No answer again.</p>

<p>“Do you know that I am going back to the
city on Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Are you?—indeed!”</p>

<p>“I dare say you will not miss me.”</p>

<p>“I do not know why I should, specially.”</p>

<p>“That is unfriendly.”</p>

<p>“Is it? Well,” rousing herself a trifle, “I
suppose we <em>do</em> miss any one with whom we
have had a bright, pleasant time. And your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Aunt Lucy will be very sorry to have you go.”</p>

<p>“And yet, she will have you.”</p>

<p>“I am only one of the incidentals, Mr. Ogden.
People who don’t belong truly, step into each
others’ lives and when the time comes, step out
again. But one born in the household is different.”</p>

<p>“They all like you—so much. I am almost
jealous of uncle Churchill’s regard.”</p>

<p>“O, you need not be.”</p>

<p>“He is old-fashioned and strict in some of his
notions, but he has a splendid heart.”</p>

<p>“I believe that.”</p>

<p>“O, Miss Endicott, please look back at this
sunset! It is still more glorious than the one
we saw the evening of our ride! Do you know,
I hate to return. Everything is so lovely here.”</p>

<p>Some of the wide fields lay in the shade,
some in the bronze light of the dying sun. All
the tree-tops were burnished, and now it was so
still that not a leaf stirred. A distant Whip-poor-will
began his melancholy lay.</p>

<p>“Oh, we must hurry on;” said Fanny recollecting
herself. “The others have passed the
curve of the road and are out of sight.”</p>

<p>They quickened their pace a trifle. Presently
he inquired—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“What is to be done to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Why—nothing.”</p>

<p>“No tea parties nor croquet?”</p>

<p>“I believe not. We shall all be tired. I have
had two or three weeks of dissipation and think
it high time to rest up a little.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you take a drive with me? That
will not be tiresome. About four in the afternoon,
say.”</p>

<p>Fan started again.</p>

<p>“I think I would rather not;” she replied, curtly.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“For various reasons that I cannot enumerate.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you have more than one, for that
might be rather hard upon me. Well, can I
come over to tea then? that is if you are not
to have other company.”</p>

<p>“I dare say they will all be glad to entertain
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wish any one but just <em>you</em>. I shall
have to take the others part of the time. But
on my last day I deserve some indulgence.”</p>

<p>“I may not feel indulgent;” she answered
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Miss Fanny—and I have so many things to
ask!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t ask them;” she said recklessly. Was
she walking into another fire?</p>

<p>“I must ask one.”</p>

<p>She expressed no curiosity or anxiety, but
her heart beat so loudly it seemed as if he must
hear it. Dick Fairlie’s love-making had been
honest and true, but this young man?—So she
walked on more rapidly.</p>

<p>“Yes; one question. How else should I know?
And it is too great a risk to leave you here with
no word—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden, I think you have lost your
senses;” she interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>“I thought so myself to-day. When you went
off with that Fairlie! I know he was with you
this afternoon, and I resolved then to have my
say. I do not mean to lose through being a
laggard. My darling, can you—do you—?”</p>

<p>Fan turned and faced him. She was cool and
angry.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden,” she said decisively, “that is
enough! It may be your habit to make love to
city girls on a fortnight’s acquaintance, but it
is not mine to receive it. I have been friendly
because I thought you a gentleman!”</p>

<p>“Fanny! Miss Endicott,” and he confronted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
her in so authoritative a fashion, that she felt
his strength at once. “You mistake me altogether.
I am <em>not</em> in the habit of trifling. If I
speak soon it is because I must leave you, and I
know another loves you. You have only to say
that you prefer him, and I will be silent.”</p>

<p>He waited several minutes for her to answer,
but how could she? It was a cruel strait. Her
cheeks were crimson with shame.</p>

<p>“Then I think I have a right to be heard.”</p>

<p>She summoned all her reckless bravery.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden,” she began in an ironical tone;
“how long do you suppose you <em>could</em> remember?
It would be the wildest of folly to listen
to you.”</p>

<p>“You doubt me altogether! What shall I do
to convince you? Let me have that withered
rose at your throat. I gave it to you this morning
and it will be precious to me. How long a
probation will you set me—a year? Well,
when you receive this rose back some day you
will know that I am of the same mind.”</p>

<p>He took it and dropped it into his pocket
memorandum. Then they walked on in silence.</p>

<p>On the way the children were dispersed nearest
their homes. By the Church, Fanny and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
Ogden came up with the last. She did not dare
leave him or she would have joined her father.
A kind of fascination kept her under his influence.</p>

<p>They paused at the gate. The others had
entered.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to come to-morrow?” His
tone was almost peremptory.</p>

<p>“I—no—” Hers sounded as if tears were
not far off, and the long lashes shaded her eyes,
but still he read the face, and read in it, furthermore,
something she did not know was there.</p>

<p>“Very well. If you love me, as I hope you
will some day, I can wait. You will learn how
truly every word was meant. I think then you
will be noble enough to admit it. Good by,
little darling.”</p>

<p>He gave her one kiss and was gone. She
flew up the path and into the wide hall, pale as
a ghost.</p>

<p>We were all there, mamma with baby in her
arms, tiny Tim hanging to her skirt, Lily and
Daisy talking like two chatter-boxes. There
was a promiscuous heap of hats and baskets on
the floor.</p>

<p>“Children!” exclaimed papa, “don’t set your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
mother crazy! Take some of these articles to
the kitchen. There, I nearly stepped into some
one’s hat. Rose my dear—”</p>

<p>Fan entered at this moment. Papa stood first,
so she put her arm around his neck and gave a
little sob.</p>

<p>“My dear girl, you are tired to death! How
pale you look. Mamma would a cup of tea do
her any good? And isn’t our supper ready?”</p>

<p>I hung up the hats, and sent Daisy off with
a cargo of baskets.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want a mouthful,” Fan said.
“It was a splendid day, but I am tired to the
uttermost and would like to drop into bed without
a word. Or if I was Edith and mamma
could cuddle me in her arms. Oh dear!”</p>

<p>I think that mamma guessed something was
amiss. She gave baby to me and went straight
to Fan.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, darling, what would the world
be without you? I feel as if I had been lost
somewhere and just come to light. Do I really
belong to you?”</p>

<p>With that she gave a little hysterical laugh
which ended with passionate crying.</p>

<p>“I am a baby, there! I am ashamed of myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
Let me run and put away my toggery,
and maybe I shall come to my senses.”</p>

<p>The children were washed and brushed. Stuart
had just come in, and we sat down to the table.
Fanny entered presently, but she neither ate nor
drank, and seemed to be quite unlike herself.</p>

<p>Indeed, I do not think she came to her senses
until she and mamma had a good long talk, she
lying in her fresh, cool bed. The friendly dusk
hid her scarlet cheeks, but it could not keep
her voice steady. All the naughtiness was confessed
except the little that could not be told
until long afterward, when events justified it.</p>

<p>“My dear girl, I am extremely sorry, and yet
I do not know how you could have avoided the
trouble. You did quite right if you could not
love Mr. Fairlie, and Mr. Ogden’s haste was
ungenerous and inexcusable. I am glad you had
the good sense to see this. And now go to
sleep my darling. If we have any better thoughts
to-morrow we will comfort one another with
them.”</p>

<p>So she kissed her and left her alone.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> were all pretty tired the next morning.
The children slept late, and Fanny
was unusually languid for her.—Stuart
was the only one who did not appear to
feel the effects of dissipation, for he was off
bright and early on another excursion with the
boys.</p>

<p>It seemed so strange to think of Fan having
had two offers of marriage; at least, one we
knew was made in good faith. The other mamma
was not decided about.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl;” said papa kissing her.
“Your troubles are beginning early in life.”</p>

<p>“You think like the old lady in the couplet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Wires and briars, needles and pins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When you are married your trouble begins.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and Fan laughed with a trifle of the old archness.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. Your mamma and I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
very happy.” Still there was a perplexed expression
on papa’s face as if he could not quite explain
the puzzle.</p>

<p>“But then no one ever could be as good or as
splendid or as lovely as you!”</p>

<p>“Any more adjectives, Fanny!” and he smiled.</p>

<p>“Yes, a host of them, but I am generous and
spare your blushes. Mamma—” in a sort of
absent, thoughtful way, “there is one man who,
I think, would make a royal husband.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure you understand the requisite
qualities?”</p>

<p>Fanny blushed.</p>

<p>“It is Stephen Duncan. I don’t know what
put it in my mind. But he seems so tender and
thoughtful and patient.”</p>

<p>“He must have taken all the family virtues,”
I made answer.</p>

<p>“He was different in his boyhood from the
others;” said papa. “He is a fine and noble
man.”</p>

<p>“But what troubles me most now,” began
Fanny with a certain funny lugubriousness, “is
how I am to meet all these people again. What
will the Churchills think? And oh, if Dick had
not—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Such matters have to settle themselves,” returned
mamma. “In all probability the Churchills
will know nothing about it. Try and be a little
careful in the future. You are no longer a
child.”</p>

<p>“Must I wear a veil or enter a convent?
Papa, suppose you lock me up in the study?
Then they will all flock to Rose, and it will be
the same trouble over again. What <em>are</em> we to
do?”</p>

<p>“Just now you had better find some employment.
I cut out half a dozen aprons for Daisy
yesterday;” said mamma.</p>

<p>“Then I will open my beloved machine, so
good-bye to romance. Work and you are adversaries.”</p>

<p>I wondered how she could take events so
coolly. She sang with her sewing as if her heart
was as light as thistle-down.</p>

<p>Nelly in the meanwhile was made ready and
sent off to visit an old parishioner, living on
a farm thirty miles away. One of the children
went for awhile every summer.</p>

<p>Louis improved rapidly. He had fretted somewhat
about accepting the Churchills’ carriage,
and begged papa to hire one for him, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
been done. He went out nearly every morning
now, or if it was too warm, late in the afternoon.
I think he was getting a little humanized,
too. Occasionally he joined our circle and
would often play with baby Edith, who laughed
and talked her fashion if you looked at her.
She was just as good and sweet as she could
be.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden did <em>not</em> come over, and went away
on Saturday. That somehow stamped the episode
as pastime. With all her gayety Fan <em>did</em>
feel badly over it—a trifle mortified, I think,
that he should have ventured upon such a freedom.</p>

<p>It was to make no change with the Churchills
however. Indeed, we received quite a handsome
compliment from them the next week.
Mr. Churchill invited papa to go up in the
mountains with him. He had some business
with a tract of woodland that the railroad company
wanted to purchase, and thought it would
be a nice trip. They were to start Tuesday
night and return Saturday noon.</p>

<p>The house always appeared so strange without
him. Not but what mamma was quite capable
of carrying it on, yet we missed him sadly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Ann lamented Nelly’s absence, and declared
“there wasn’t a childer too many”. Fan and I
sewed and had peculiar talks with Louis. I never
could tell what he thought or what he believed,
or whether he advanced these opinions for arguments’
sake. He had a great deal of morbid
pride, and a way of putting all the briary parts
outside. Everybody was selfish, he averred.</p>

<p>And he did have a fearful temper. Beside
the quickness, it had in it a brooding vindictiveness.
He couldn’t seem to forgive injuries or
slights, and he was very jealous of Stuart, though
he affected a lofty indifference to those bright
engaging qualities.</p>

<p>Stuart on the other hand did get into a good
deal of mischief. He headed raids on the farmers’
trees and melon-patches, and one night the water
was let out of the dam, which caused a great
commotion. Of course he was an immense
favorite with the boys.</p>

<p>When papa came home there was a letter from
Stephen, answering the one announcing the illness.
He had been very much perplexed in the
business and found it necessary to go to Paris.
He would not be able to return until late in the
Fall. As school began the tenth of September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
it would be best to send Stuart immediately.
Would Mrs. Endicott see that his clothes were
in order? If Louis preferred, when he was well
enough to resume his studies, to board in some
quiet family and take the lessons he needed,
Stephen considered it a better plan.</p>

<p>“Not that I mean this to be construed into
a desire for you to keep him, my dear friend,”
he wrote. “You have too much on your hands
already, and I feel as if I had added a great burthen.
But if he decides upon this course will
you make some inquiries for him, and help him
to find a suitable person? I do not think him
strong enough to be regularly in school.”</p>

<p>Louis made no comment for several days, then
declared that he did not mean to be buried
alive in a country village through a dreary winter.
He would go back to Wilburton, but not
enter the school. There were plenty of families
who would take him to board, and he liked it
there.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture one of his cousins, a year
or two older than himself, invited him to go to
Canada to recruit his health. He was to start
early in September and would call for him.</p>

<p>He accepted the invitation at once, without
even consulting papa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose it is as well, though,” papa said
thoughtfully. “He does need bracing up, and
the change will be just the thing for him. We
can hear meanwhile from Stephen about this
Wilburton arrangement.”</p>

<p>The boys both went to Westburg with papa
to get some new clothes. Mamma packed
Stuart’s trunk, and then he was frantic to return
to the boys. Monday would be the tenth but
he insisted upon starting on Friday. He wanted
to get a good room, to see old friends and feel
settled before school began. He had enjoyed
himself splendidly, to be sure, and there were
lots of jolly fellows in Wachusett, to say nothing
of the girls. He meant to come back some
time and have it all over. But since he couldn’t
go to Canada, which he thought rather rough,
he might as well march off at once. The
sooner a thing was well over, the better.</p>

<p>He spent a day and evening saying good-bye
to his friends in the village. The stage was to
come at eight Friday morn. He had his trunk
strapped and out on the porch; ate his breakfast
in a hurry, kissed the children and bade
Ann a laughing farewell accompanied with a
new calico gown, which she thought an immense
favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>Papa gave him a little counsel in a low tone
of voice, but I do not think he listened very
attentively. He was a boy without a bit of
sentiment or tender regard. He merely sang
out—“Good-bye, old chap,” to Louis, and
though he thanked us for our kindness, it was
only from a gentlemanly instinct. Then he
sprang into the stage and was off.</p>

<p>“I do not know whether I should like to
have such a son or not,” mamma said slowly,
as we entered papa’s study. “He is bright and
manly and entertaining, but he leaves you with
a feeling that out of sight is out of mind.”</p>

<p>“I have tried to sow a little good seed;” yet
papa shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>“But you are afraid it is in sandy ground;”
Fan added, with a touch of comforting sweetness
in her voice. “I haven’t much faith in its
bearing fruit, and yet I do believe he has come
to have more consideration for Louis. He has
not tormented him half as much lately. That
would be one point gained.”</p>

<p>“Yes. After all, I have more hope of Louis.
The struggle will be much harder, for his temperament
and his health are against him, but
he will be steadier in anything he undertakes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
I have become deeply interested in both of
them, and I do not feel as if it was going to end
here.”</p>

<p>It seemed as if the day was to be rendered
memorable for us. In the midst of the talk
came a sudden hard ring. I answered it and
found Mr. Fairlie’s man with a frightened look
in his face.</p>

<p>“If you please, Miss—is your father in?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Papa!”</p>

<p>He came at the summons.</p>

<p>“The master is—very bad, sir. They want
to see you right away. Mister Dick is taking
it very hard.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fairlie!” exclaimed papa in amaze.—“Why,
I saw him yesterday, and well.”</p>

<p>“He’s been rather queer in his head for two
or three days. It was the sun or something.—And
about midnight he was taken. The Doctor
has given him up now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said papa, bewildered. “I’ll be there
directly.”</p>

<p>“I’ve the wagon here for you, sir.”</p>

<p>He just kissed mamma and went without
another word. Such calls left no room for discussions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“It cannot be possible!” ejaculated Fan.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Fairlie and Kate away!” said mamma.
“How very sad.”</p>

<p>We had not the heart to talk about it and
separated for our morning’s employment. School
had begun again, so I made the children ready.
Nelly had just entered the Seminary. Then I
put my rooms in order while Fan assisted in
the kitchen. Tabby came up stairs followed by
her small gray and white kitten, who was a
puffy ball of frolic. She glanced around the
room in a curious, complacent fashion.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tabby,” I said, “the plague of your
life has departed. Mrs. Whitcomb will be here
next, and you know she is fond of you, so your
troubles are ending. I don’t believe we have
learned to like boys so <em>very</em> much, after all.”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Tabby, with a grave whisk
of the tail, while the kitten made a vigorous
attack on the bits of sunshine quivering through
the great sycamore leaves.</p>

<p>I went down stairs and sewed awhile in the
nursery. Dinner came, but no papa. Louis had
returned from his drive and looked very cheerful.
We could not wait on account of the
children, and unconsciously his prolonged absence
gave us a little hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>It was dashed down presently. The church
bell began to toll. We glanced at each other
in a startled way.</p>

<p>“Poor Dick!” said Fan, turning her head,
and I knew her eyes were full of tears. I
could not help a curious thought. What if
this sorrow should bring them together?</p>

<p>Miss Churchill made us a nice long call in
the afternoon, and before she had gone papa
returned. Dick had begged him to stay and go
to the station for Mrs. Fairlie who had just
come, and do several other special errands for
him. The ladies had stopped on their homeward
way at the house of a cousin in Bridgeport,
and were thus easily reached by telegraph.</p>

<p>“What a terrible shock!” exclaimed Miss
Churchill. “A man in almost perfect health,
too; though Dr. Hawley I believe mentioned
his having some trouble with his heart. Was
that the cause?”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt it helped materially. He
had complained of a dull, heavy headache for
two or three days, and yesterday he was out in
the sun which appeared to affect him a good
deal. At midnight he was taken with paralysis.
But brief as the time was it found him ready.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
He seemed to have gleams of consciousness and
knew me at intervals. His trust was staid upon
God, and there was no fear, no shrinking.”</p>

<p>“He has been a good, upright man. Kenton
always esteemed him highly.”</p>

<p>“He was more than that, Miss Churchill, he
was an earnest Christian. If the household had
been of one mind, workers in the vineyard, he
would have lived a fuller and more joyous
christian life. But we are to work our way
through hindrances. God gave him grace and
strength and perfected him in good deeds. I
feel as if I had lost my mainstay in the church.
He was not a man of many words, but you
could rely upon him to the uttermost. And
though I shall grieve for a true and staunch
friend, I shall also rejoice that he has gone to
his reward, better far than any earthly happiness.”</p>

<p>“You loved him very much,” said Miss
Churchill, deeply moved.</p>

<p>“I did indeed.”</p>

<p>“The loss is dreadful to his family.”</p>

<p>“My heart ached for Richard. He and his
father were tender friends, and the watching
through long hours, the not being able to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
him up, was agonizing in the extreme. Mrs.
Fairlie was stunned by the suddenness.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if I could be any—comfort to
her?” Miss Churchill questioned slowly.</p>

<p>“I wish you would call to-morrow,” said papa.
“I don’t know but I shall have to come to you
and your brother now.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I should be glad to give you any
assistance in my power. I have been thinking
lately that we live quite too much for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“For the night cometh in which no man can
work,” said papa solemnly.</p>

<p>An awe fell over us all. One and another
dropped in to wonder at the occurrence. Sudden
deaths always shock a community greatly.
Even the children did not want to play but sat
on the porch steps and looked into vacancy.
Louis went up stairs directly after supper, but
I heard him pacing his room restlessly. I had
put the little ones to bed and was going down
stairs when he called.</p>

<p>“Did you want anything?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“No—that is—are you busy?”</p>

<p>“Not especially.”</p>

<p>“I am going away so soon;” he said apologetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“And if I can do anything for you, I shall
be glad to,” I made answer cheerfully. “Shall
I come in and read?”</p>

<p>“Thank you—I don’t care about that, I am
in an odd, inconsequent mood to night. Suppose
you talk to me? I believe your voice has
a soothing effect.”</p>

<p>“Let us go down on the porch. It is cooler.”</p>

<p>“Where are the others?”</p>

<p>“Papa and Fanny have gone for a call. Mamma
is in the nursery.”</p>

<p>“O, I wanted only you.”</p>

<p>“Come down then.”</p>

<p>I brought an easy chair out on the porch, and
dropped into my own small rocker. Tabby came
along and crawled in my lap, turning round
three times and settling herself regardless of the
welfare of her small child, though I dare say
she was asleep in some one’s slipper. The moon
was nearly at its full and made silvery shadows
through the interstices of the vines. The dewy
air was fragrant and the night musical with
chirp and hum of countless insects.</p>

<p>“It is quite a relief to be rid of Stuart,” he
began presently. “And when I am gone you
will doubtless feel still more comfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“I think you are quite comfortable to get on
with now;” I said cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Which implies—there was a time. Miss
Endicott, do you think I have improved <em>any</em>?”</p>

<p>“I do not know as it would be hardly fair to
judge you by the first week or two. You were
on the eve of a severe illness, with your nervous
system completely disorganized.”</p>

<p>“But since then—be honest?”</p>

<p>“I think you have been pleasanter, more considerate,
not so easily ruffled;” I answered
slowly.</p>

<p>“Please don’t fancy me fishing for compliments.”</p>

<p>“Compliments from me would not be so <em>very</em>
flattering to one’s vanity. They do not carry
weight enough.”</p>

<p>“You believe that one could overcome—any
fault?” after a pause between the words.</p>

<p>“With God’s help—yes.”</p>

<p>“Without God’s help—what then?”</p>

<p>I was always so afraid of going astray in
these talks. I could feel what I meant, but I
could not explain it clearly.</p>

<p>“‘Every good and perfect gift cometh from
God,’” I made answer. “And the desire to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
better or stronger, to overcome any fault, must
proceed from Him.”</p>

<p>“Then why doesn’t he make Christians perfect?”</p>

<p>“God gives us the work to do. He says, ‘My
grace shall be sufficient for thee.’ Therefore we
are to strive ourselves. He shows us the right
way, but if we seek out other paths, or if we
sink into indolence waiting for an angel to come
and move our idle hands or stir up our languid
wills, can we reasonably blame Him?”</p>

<p>“I had not thought of that, I must confess.
I had a fancy that—religion did all these things
for you.”</p>

<p>“What then is the Christian warfare? You
know that grand old St. Paul had to fight to
the last, that he might not be a cast-away. Yet
I think no one ever doubted the genuineness of
his conversion.”</p>

<p>“But if a man of his own determination, resolved,
he could do a great deal.”</p>

<p>“I should be weak to deny it. People have
achieved heroic victories, suffered pain and shame
and death bravely for pride, or some chosen
idea. Only when it is done for the sake of
Him who saved us, it becomes so much the
more noble. It is obeying Him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“Is it an easy thing to be good, Miss Endicott?”</p>

<p>“Not for every one,” I said.</p>

<p>“You admit that natures are different?”</p>

<p>“I do, cheerfully. Some people have very
little self-control, others a great deal. But it is
strengthened by use, like a limb.”</p>

<p>“I have very little?”</p>

<p>“I did not say that.”</p>

<p>“But you know I have.”</p>

<p>“Papa said your temperament and your health
were against you!”</p>

<p>“Did he say that?” was the eager question.
“Well there <em>are</em> a hundred things—I sometimes
have such headaches that I can hardly tell
where I am, and if anything bothers me I feel
as if I could stamp on it, crush it out of existence.
And if it is a person—”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I cried, “don’t please! That is murder
in one’s heart.”</p>

<p>“And when any one annoys Stuart he
laughs at him, flings, jeers and exasperates. It
is his way, yet every one thinks he has a lovely
temper. He makes others angry. I have seen
him get half a class by the ears, and in such a
mess that no one knew what was the matter.—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
do not believe I ever in my life set about
making another person angry. But I cannot
stand such things. They stir up all the bad
blood in me.”</p>

<p>“So you need patience, first of all.”</p>

<p>“But I <em>can’t</em> stop to think.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is just it. Stopping to think saves
us. And when we have our great Captain to
remember, and are endeavoring to walk in the
path He marked out for us, it makes it easier.
We are trying for the sake of one we love.”</p>

<p>“What else do I want?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me, please,” I entreated.</p>

<p>“Yes. I shall not let you evade me. Write
me some copies to take with me. Patience—what
next?”</p>

<p>“Cheerfulness;” seeing that he compelled me
to it. “Your nature is morbid and melancholy.
Just try to think that people will like you.</p>

<p>“But they do not.”</p>

<p>“Then you must give them something to like.
Suppose we all hid away our brightness?”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“It would be a rather blue world. But to
try for admiration.”</p>

<p>“You don’t try for <em>admiration</em>. You give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
freely of the very best you have. You remember
about the little boy who hid his cake away
until it was mouldy and spoiled?”</p>

<p>“I believe you always give of the best here.
And you never seem to have any lack.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever break off a sprig of lemon verbena?
Three new shoots come in its place.
When I was a little girl mamma explained it to
me, and said that if you nipped off one bit of
pleasantness for a friend or neighbor, something
grew instantly for the next one. You never
give away all your joy and good feeling.”</p>

<p>He sighed a little, and said slowly—</p>

<p>“I believe I shall begin with my temper. I
have always known that it was bad, and expected
to keep it all my life, but if it could be made a
little more reasonable!”</p>

<p>“I am sure it can, if you will try. It <em>is</em> hard
work to be fighting continually, to be on your
guard against surprises, and sometimes to have
your best efforts misunderstood, yet it seems to
me a grand thing to gain a victory over one’s
self.”</p>

<p>“You make it so;” he replied in a half
doubtful tone.</p>

<p>“I wish you could be good friends with papa.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
He is so much wiser, and can explain the puzzles.
When you came to know him well you
would like him, you couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Sometime—when I want such a friend;” he
answered a trifle coldly.</p>

<p>The voices sounded on the walk just then,
and in a few moments they came up. We had
no special talk after that.</p>

<p>Mamma went over to Mrs. Fairlie’s the next
day and met Miss Churchill there. Kate had
been in violent hysterics all night. They appeared
so utterly helpless. What should they do
about black? There wasn’t any thing decent in
Wachusett! And could Mrs. Fairlie find a long
widow’s veil any where? There would not be
time to send to the city.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure that Mrs. Silverthorne has
one. Hers was very beautiful and she never
wore it but a little; and a plain bonnet will
do.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Churchill. How kind you
are. But I cannot understand <em>why</em> this grief
should come upon me.”</p>

<p>“God’s ways are not as our ways;” said
mamma.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Fairlie was needed so much. I
don’t know how I can live without him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>Mamma and Miss Churchill soothed and tried
to comfort. Each took a few orders on leaving.</p>

<p>“My objection to mourning is just this,” said
Miss Churchill, when they were seated in her
basket phaeton. “In the midst of your grief
you have to stop and think wherewithal you
shall be clothed. Dress-makers and milliners are
your constant care for the first month.”</p>

<p>“The fashion of this world;” mamma replied
a little sadly.</p>

<p>That afternoon Louis received a telegram from
his cousin. He would meet him the next noon
at the station in a through train, that there might
be no lost time. He only packed a valise, as
his trunk would be sent to Wilburton. We said
our good-byes in quite a friendly fashion. He appeared
really grateful and sorry to leave us.
Papa went to the station with him and returned
in an unusually grave mood.</p>

<p>We kept up to the tense point of excitement
until after Mr. Fairlie’s funeral. It was largely
attended, and very solemn and affecting. Indeed,
nearly every heart ached for Kate and her
mother.</p>

<p>“But I do believe Dick suffers the most;”
Fanny said. “I never saw any one so changed
in a few days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>Afterward the will was read. The farm was
bequeathed to Richard. Stocks, bonds and mortgages
were divided between Mrs. Fairlie and
Kate, who were thus made quite rich women.
They could go to Europe now.</p>

<p>I found myself wondering a little what Mr.
Fairlie’s life would have been with different
surroundings. The Fairlies in their way were
as old and as good a family as the Churchills,
only they did not happen to settle at the West
Side, and had gone a little more into active
business. But they did not lay claim to any
special position or grandeur. This had always
seemed to mortify Mrs. Fairlie somewhat. “Mr.
Fairlie is so old-fashioned,” she would say complainingly.
“There was no getting him out of
the one groove.” She wanted to make a show,
to have people admit that she was somebody.—She
went to church regularly and would have
been much offended not to have been considered
an important member. She gave to the Christmas
and Easter feasts and adornings, but for
the poor or the needy sick she rarely evinced
any sympathy. Her duty stopped at a certain
point, the rest of her time, money, and interest
was distinctly her own. So the husband and
wife lived separate lives, as it were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Would Richard’s fate repeat the same confused
and tangled story? No doubt his mother
would desire him to marry well in worldly point
of view. She might even object to Fan on
the score of money. Would he have the
courage to suit himself? For what he needed
was a sweet, domestic woman with the culture
that did not disdain every day matters. His
tastes were simple and homelike, yet he was by
no means dull. He wanted a woman to honor
him, to put him in his true position as head
of the family.</p>

<p>Would Providence bring him happiness, or
discipline only?</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> next thing that happened to us was—though
to be exact, it was two
events. In the morning papa had a
long, lovely letter from Stephen Duncan, enclosing
a check for two hundred dollars on the
boys’ account, and one for fifty to mamma, to
fill up the chinks made by the sickness, he said.
The Doctor’s bill he would settle when he came
home. Papa read most of it aloud, and I saw
mamma’s sweet, dark eyes fill with tears.</p>

<p>We were beginning a new week, and alone
by ourselves. That always reminds me of the
story papa used to tell of a traveler who passed
a house where there were seven children sitting
on the stoop, and seven on the fence, all crying
as hard as they could cry, so he paused to ask
what dreadful thing had happened.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said they with one voice, “our mother
has gone away and left us all alone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>It was pretty much the same with us, only
we did not cry for any one gone away. It was
delightful to have our house by ourselves.—Though
it seemed so queer that we lounged
around and amused each other making wonderful
plans.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mrs. Whitcomb arrived with
her large basket. We all rushed out and kissed
her, and almost distracted her with our avalanche
of news. Fan untied her bonnet, I took her
shawl and mamma turned one glove into the
other after her own careful fashion.</p>

<p>“The wear seems to have told most upon
you, Mrs. Endicott,” she said with sweet solicitude.
“First of all, girls, your mother must
have a holiday!”</p>

<p>We looked at each other blankly, then laughed.</p>

<p>“She shall have whatever is best;” returned
Fan with much dignity.</p>

<p>“Then she must go away. Let me see—among
the mountains somewhere, to an old
farm-house where she can have milk, and sweet
corn, and sleep eighteen hours out of the twenty-four.
She must not take a stitch of sewing.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” I declared, clapping my hands.</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Nelly, “won’t you go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
Auntie Vandevere’s, mamma? They want you
to come so much.”</p>

<p>“Now there is a place provided,” said Mrs.
Whitcomb. “You know you were going all
last summer and did not get started. It is just
the season to enjoy yourself. The girls and I
can keep house. We will have everything
bright as a new gilt button on your return.—And
Edith is so good, or you might take one
of the children to mind her. Children come in
so handy.”</p>

<p>“O mamma, me!” and Tim jumped up and
down as incoherently as her sentence.</p>

<p>“The house cleaning—” protested mamma
faintly, Tim’s arms being around her neck in a
strangling fashion by this time.</p>

<p>“We will clean house, mend the stockings,
weed the flower beds, and keep matters straight.
You will hardly know the place when you
return.”</p>

<p>“Here, Tim, look after your village! Baby
has commenced to devour the cows, and I think
them a rather heavy article of diet for her just
yet.”</p>

<p>“What is one little make-believe cow?” said
Tim disdainfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“Well, pick up the fragments. And here is
Miss Dolly looking tired and sleepy. Then run
out and play.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to;” cried the younger ones
in chorus.</p>

<p>“Well, have your own way;” and Fan sat
down in mock despair. “I am determined to
be obeyed in some respect.”</p>

<p>After we had them all snugly tucked in bed
that evening, the elders discussed the plan again.
Papa approved of it so strongly that he wrote
the letter immediately.</p>

<p>“But there is so much to do,” declared mamma.
“I intended to change the girls to the
front chamber and put Nelly and Daisy in theirs.
And we want a new carpet for the study, and—oh,
I don’t believe I can go!”</p>

<p>“There is always some path out of the
woods;” said Mrs. Whitcomb when our laugh
had subsided. “You need the rest—that is the
strongest argument. And I have come to help.
You cannot make me company if you try.”</p>

<p>On the following day we had it all out straight.
The three seniors were to go to Westburg on
Thursday and buy everything they could lay
their hands upon. Friday afternoon mamma was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
to take her journey. The next week on Wednesday
or Thursday papa was to go up after
her, the two to come home on Saturday. There
it was all as plain and easy as “twice two” in
the multiplication table.</p>

<p>They started bright and early in the morning.
Fan and I went at the front chamber. There
was not much to do, for the walls were papered.
Ann cleaned the paint, we washed windows and
rubbed the paper with a soft cloth, then she
shook the carpet for us and we tacked it down.</p>

<p>“It seems odd to move over to this side of the
house,” said Fan, “but I shall like it ever so
much. And Nell will be so pleased. She hates to
be packed like pins in a paper. But now comes
the tug of war—clothes, bureau drawers, odds
and ends, and the plagues of Egypt.”</p>

<p>“O no;” I returned laughingly.</p>

<p>“Well—flies, anyhow. They are not all
gone.”</p>

<p>There was a large old-fashioned chest of drawers
in the room. We brought in our dainty bureau
with its pretty glass, and I gave up all the
drawers to Fan, taking the other. There was a
nice wardrobe for our dresses and boxes. When
Nelly returned from school she helped with our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
pictures and brackets, and we had ourselves
as well as our room in order before the travelers
returned. Baby had been good as an angel
all day. I dressed her clean and put on one
of the pretty bibs that Daisy had crocheted, and
Ann had the supper table in readiness.</p>

<p>They were all tired, enough, though we had
bound them by solemn promises not to do any
of our fall shopping. They had made a few
calls, selected the carpet and made arrangements
to have papa’s study chair covered with Russia
leather. So we kissed them and made them
welcome, both ladies being somewhat surprised
by our day’s work.</p>

<p>It was beautiful on Friday, and there was not
the least shadow of an excuse for mamma to
stay. Not that we were so very glad to have
her go, after all, but we knew it would bring
forth good fruit in the end. Tim was about
half crazy and brought all her play-things to be
packed up, but mamma compromised by taking
her large rag doll, as the baby could play with
that.</p>

<p>“Girls,” said Mrs. Whitcomb on Saturday
morning, “suppose we begin at the other rooms.
Nelly and Daisy can do a good deal in the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
of helping. I want to get the house all in order
before your mother returns. And there will be
the carpet to make the first of the week.”</p>

<p>“Agreed;” we all said, and went at it with
a good will. Daisy declared “that it was almost
as splendid as moving, and she hoped sometime
we would move.” She was too young to remember
the discomforts of our coming to Wachusett.</p>

<p>This was a regular frolic. Mrs. Whitcomb
was so charming with her ways of quiet fun and
odd bits of wisdom. Like mamma, she knew
how to begin at the right end, and make matters
go on smoothly. There is such a difference
in that. She kept the children good-natured
and we were all as busy as bees.</p>

<p>Just as we were hurrying our utmost, about
mid-afternoon a carriage stopped. Daisy ran to
the side window to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>“It is the Maynards,” she announced, “and
a whole load of ladies.”</p>

<p>“Some one must go—Rose!”</p>

<p>“O, dear, no, not—”</p>

<p>“For Joe, to be slangy,” and Fan laughed.
“But you have just finished the carpet, and you
are the eldest, and you can brush up your hair
so quickly. Here, wash your face and I’ll get
out your dress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>I washed and brushed, or rather just ran the
comb through my hair and twisted it in a great
knot, put on some tidy slippers and a blue
cambric with ruffles at the wrist and throat.
While I was fastening my brooch Fan tied a
pale blue ribbon in my hair.</p>

<p>“There, you look as sweet as a pink, only I
never saw any blue pinks. Don’t say you are
just out of the soap-suds. Remember to uphold
the family credit.”</p>

<p>It was “all of the Maynards,” and a very
elegant young gentleman. Mrs. Silverthorne and
the Misses Maynards were going West next
week, and had come to make a farewell call.
They were very sorry to miss mamma—how could
we get along without her?</p>

<p>I said Mrs. Whitcomb was here taking charge
of us.</p>

<p>“There;” began Mrs. Silverthorne, “Matilda,
I don’t see why you can’t get her to come and
stay with grandma this winter, and you go to
the City for two months or so. I am sure if
Mrs. Endicott feels it safe to leave all of her
children, you might leave just one person.”</p>

<p>“Mamma has the baby and my youngest sister
with her,” I returned. “And she only
expects to stay a week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>I could not see that the cases were at all
parallel.</p>

<p>“Well, this Mrs. Whitcomb is a nice, trusty
sort of person, is she not? Doesn’t she take
care of sick people?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she is very lovely.”</p>

<p>“<em>That</em> is only for your equals, my child;”
she returned patronizingly.</p>

<p>I flushed but made no answer.</p>

<p>“Whose crayon drawing?” asked Miss Maynard,
making a tour of inspection through the
room.</p>

<p>“My sister Fanny’s.”</p>

<p>“O—the one with that lovely golden hair—is
it not? Miss Lucy Churchill raves about her.
Why she has quite a talent. Does she think of
studying?”</p>

<p>“Not at present;” I replied.</p>

<p>“She is very young;” said Mrs. Maynard.</p>

<p>“If I were not going away I should be
pleased to give her some lessons. I think one
ought to foster talent when one is in a position
to do it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you;” I returned with a little pride.
“Miss Churchill intends to give her lessons.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Well, I have some friends connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
with the School of Design in New York.
I might do something for her there.”</p>

<p>I simply thanked her again.</p>

<p>They left regrets and kind messages, and
swept through the hall in a complacent fashion.</p>

<p>I ran up stairs and took off my dress in a
hurry.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t worth the trouble;” I declared
with some disgust. “I really think I could find
more intellectual enjoyment in tacking down
carpets. I am sure I could in hanging pictures.”</p>

<p>“What a depraved taste! And West Side
people, too!”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, Miss Churchill would have
been charming.” Then I repeated Miss Maynard’s
offers.</p>

<p>“Very thoughtful of her;” said Fan dryly.—“People
in her position can do many nice things
if they try. I would not have hung that picture
in the parlor if it had not been for papa.”</p>

<p>“Our parlor is our own,” replied I.</p>

<p>“No, it belongs in part to the parish.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitcomb laughed at that.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t this room be lovely,” said Nelly.
“Why, I could swing Tabby around in it without
hitting the children!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“Let me catch you swinging Tabby! She
has passed through purgatory.”</p>

<p>“And these book-shelves are just the thing.
Daisy, they are mine, do you understand? If I
find one of your books here I shall put it in
the middle of the floor.”</p>

<p>“That will have one merit at least, I can see
it there.”</p>

<p>We finished the two rooms by night, and
then had callers all the evening. But Sunday
without mamma seemed quite out of the order
of things. I knew papa felt lost, though we all
tried to do our best. Once it came into my
mind what the house would be without her forever,
and my eyes filled with tears. We sat
together an hour after church, talking about her.</p>

<p>We went to work again the first of the week.
The carpet had come and was very pretty. A
mossy, fine figured vine in two shades of green,
with a dash of crimson here and there. The
lounge had been covered the year before with
green reps and still looked bright.</p>

<p>“How pretty it will be!” I said, “I am all
impatience to see it down and the room in
order. The carpet comes just like a present,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“We have forgotten the work and the worry.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was a good thing for us. And
somehow I do believe it will prove good for
Louis Duncan.”</p>

<p>“When will we go at the study, Mrs. Whitcomb?”</p>

<p>“Not until your father is out of the house.”</p>

<p>A ring at the bell startled us.</p>

<p>“West Side again;” said Mrs. Whitcomb;—“Miss
Churchill.”</p>

<p>“O, please come in here;” exclaimed Fanny
with a laugh. “It is only a step from—dress-making
to carpets.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” and she smiled. “Who is going to
be so pretty?”</p>

<p>“Papa. Our study carpet was a thing of—shreds
and patches, rather than beauty. And
we feel as if we had earned this money ourselves.
When papa goes to the mountains we
shall have a thorough renovating.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could add something,” said Miss
Churchill. “Let me take a peep, perhaps I can
discover a new need.”</p>

<p>She glanced around. Fanny explained about
the chair.</p>

<p>“There is one thing girls, and I shall do it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
This paper is soiled and dingy, and a new one
must be put on.”</p>

<p>“It is pretty nearly covered with the books
and pictures,” returned Fanny.</p>

<p>“But it is not nice. Wednesday, you said,
Mr. Endicott was going. I will send you over
some help to get the furniture and the books out,
and on Thursday the man shall come to do it.
It will not take long.”</p>

<p>“We can do the removing, please;” and Fan
smiled archly.</p>

<p>“If you are saucy I will come myself. Here
is a basket of pears. I suppose I dare not ask
you to visit me until you have all your fortune
spent, and are bankrupt.”</p>

<p>“You will be very good to take us in then,”
I answered.</p>

<p>“I can make allowance for the pernicious
influence of wealth;” she returned gaily.</p>

<p>She was as good as her word. The coachman
come over to help us lift, he said. One
end of the room and one side of the chimney
had been put in book-shelves. Mrs. Whitcomb
thoughtfully made out a list so we could tell
where they belonged.</p>

<p>The paper and the man were according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
promise. The first was a delicate French gray
with quite wide, rich bordering that gave the
room the effect of being frescoed. It was as
pretty as a picture. When the carpet was
down, and the chair came home, which it did,
Saturday noon, we were happy as larks.</p>

<p>But the best of all was mamma and the baby.
We kissed them and cried over them a little
out of pure joy. The old tired look had gone
out of mamma’s sweet face, and her voice was
bright and cheery. And, oh, how surprised
and pleased they both were! Papa declared
that it was as good as a Christmas feast.</p>

<p>It was only a little after all. Some of the
ladies in town spent as much on one dress and
then were dissatisfied. I begin to think it is a
rare art to get a good deal of happiness out of
a small amount of material. When you work
for it yourself it does seem sweeter, if the work
is not too hard. Hunger is a good thing if one
does not pass the point of appetite, and faint.</p>

<p>Mamma thought we had accomplished wonders.
Truly the pictures did look better on the new
paper, and the bright border gave a glow and
richness. The carpet proved just the thing.
Papa called it his Castle of Indolence, because
it had such a dreamy, comfortable appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>“There is half of our fortune gone;” said
Fanny, “but I don’t grudge a penny of it. Indeed
I feel like spending the rest on dear
papa.”</p>

<p>“Papa has had his share, fully. Now I must
do some shopping for you girls. And I have a
surprise in my mind for Mrs. Whitcomb.”</p>

<p>“A present, I know. O mamma, tell us at
once.”</p>

<p>“She would not take any pay for her services
in the summer, so I shall spend part of my gift
upon her. It is one of the chinks, and I think
it can best be filled with a new dress.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing. She has a nice black silk
dress, so let this be a poplin, a beautiful dark
wine color. You know how pretty she looked in
the neck tie,” said Fan.</p>

<p>“I had been puzzling on a color. You and
Rose and Nelly must have a new winter dress
apiece.”</p>

<p>“And mine shall be wine color. <em>Can</em> we afford
poplin, mamma, real pretty, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Hardly, I think. You will want a walking
suit and what with overskirt and jacket—”</p>

<p>Fan made a mental calculation.</p>

<p>“No, mamma <em>mia</em>, it will never do. A dollar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
and a half a yard will be our utmost limit.
Well, there are lovely empress cloths. We will
be neat if we cannot be gorgeous. And if I
could have velvet like it for a hat, and a tiny
real lace collar.”</p>

<p>“I will give you each thirty-five dollars. Will
that answer?”</p>

<p>“We will make it, little mother;” I replied
cheerfully.</p>

<p>We enjoyed shopping with our own money
exceedingly. My dress was a dark green with
a bronze tint; and a felt hat to match, with
trimmings a shade lighter. Mamma gave us our
gloves and some ribbons, and we felt very grand.
Nelly’s dress was a gold and black waterproof.</p>

<p>We bought Mrs. Whitcomb’s under her very
eyes, and smiled over her comments. But when
she saw it the next morning with her name
pinned on it, and “her dear friends, Mr. and
Mrs. Endicott” as donors, her surprise and
delight were good to witness. Fan declared that
it was the most satisfactory of all.</p>

<p>Afterward we had a regular dress-making
“bee.” Mamma cut, Mrs. Whitcomb and I
basted, and Fan sewed on the machine. Miss
Oldways insisted upon coming one day, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
had a bright, cheerful time. We made Mrs.
Whitcomb’s too, though she said at first that
we should not.</p>

<p>By this time it was the middle of October.
We felt as if we had gained a march upon the
season, shopping and sewing so early, and we
were quite proud not to have taken papa’s
money. The salary was not very large, and
sometimes it required considerable planning to
make it do. Mamma used to say it was the
five loaves and the two small fishes among many,
but we <em>did</em> often find a few fragments.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitcomb had to say good-bye to us
again. We fell back into our old routine.
Fanny being at home regularly gave me much
more leisure. We took up a course of reading
with papa, and practiced our music daily. There
were walks and calls and parish visiting, so we
were not likely to be idle. The Churchills were
very kind to us. Mr. Churchill took the office
of church warden, left vacant by Mr. Fairlie’s
death. He came over now and then to discuss
church matters, and he did get a great deal
interested in the children.</p>

<p>Miss Helen Ogden was married early in December
and went abroad. Mrs. Ogden tried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
persuade Miss Lucy to go to Florida with her,
but she confessed that she had not the courage.
Mrs. Fairlie and Kate found their loneliness insupportable,
and were quite elated when she
asked them to join her. They wanted Dick to
accompany them, but he would not, declaring
that he could not leave everything at loose ends.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, we rarely heard a word about
Winthrop Ogden. He was in a Bank in New
York. He had not made his second visit as
proposed. We never said anything to each other
concerning the love episode, mamma thought
it best not to be talked about. And though
through all the trouble and grief it had been
impossible not to see Dick Fairlie frequently, he
and Fan fell into pleasantly fraternal ways.—Mamma
managed that there should be no awkwardness
and but little chance for a repetition.
She used to sit with us evenings and make
Dick talk to her. Presently he became quite
confidential with her. He had missed this peculiar
mother love and interest in his own life, and it
seemed as if he was hungering for it.</p>

<p>He improved unconsciously. He grew more
manly and self-reliant. People began to call
him Mr. Richard Fairlie, as they had called his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
father. He made little visits to cousins and one
or two school friends, though he kept his house
open with the aid of an excellent servant.</p>

<p>It is strange how the roots of things all get
together after a while, as they stretch out feelers
hither and thither. I used to think if there
was one woman in the parish who resembled
mamma in the sweet family interest that she
managed to create about those who came within
her circle it was Mrs. Ryder. Their house was
just lovely. The parlor opened into the sitting-room,
that into the dining-room, at the end of
the hall, and from thence into the kitchen.
They lived all the way through, as we did.
You commenced in the parlor but you found
every place just as good. Flowers were everywhere,
pictures everywhere, even in the kitchen
where hung “The Gossips,” a laughable engraving
of “Moving Day,” a pretty rustic catch-all
wall-pocket, and a shelf of geraniums across one
window. It wasn’t much larger than a hall bedroom,
but it was always neat and picturesque,
the more so when Jennie was in it with her
sleeves tucked up, baking or washing dishes.</p>

<p>I believe Dick recognized the resemblance between
mamma and Mrs. Ryder in this peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
motherliness. He took her to ride now and
then, and began to bring odd specimens of ferns
and dried leaves to them, and sent them some
nice fruit and vegetables from the farm. We
went with him quite often to spend the evening,
but mamma had cautioned us about dragging
Jennie injudiciously forward.</p>

<p>One day Fan and mamma were talking about
him quite confidentially, when the latter said—</p>

<p>“You do not feel inclined to repent your
decision, my dear?”</p>

<p>“No, mamma;” she answered with a little
fitful color.</p>

<p>“You have only to go on then in this manner,
and remain very cordial friends. I shall be
glad to have you. But if you should wish to
repent, now would be the auspicious time. He
is a very worthy young man.”</p>

<p>“Would you like me to, mamma?” Fan
asked in a tremor of alarm.</p>

<p>“Not unless you wish it above all things,
then you would be wrong to let a little false
pride stand in the way.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish it above all things.”</p>

<p>“My darling, we should be sorry to give you
away so soon,” and mamma kissed her fondly.
“We are a trifle selfish, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“May be I shall never go away,” Fan made
answer slowly. “Perhaps I shall be the old
maid sister instead of Rose.”</p>

<p>Mamma laughed and said she should not mind.</p>

<p>But we could all understand that Richard
Fairlie was considered a most eligible young
man. Allie West and Sue Barstow were very
cordial with him. He was asked to tea as he
could not join the gay little neighborhood parties,
and the mothers took a great interest in
him.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Merry</span> Christmas had come and gone
with its ordinary festivities and gifts.
Ours had been unusually bright, and
we were all well and happy. Only one thing
troubled papa and that was the boys.</p>

<p>Louis had spent nearly two months traveling
around and then going straight to Wilburton.
He was pleasantly situated he wrote, quite well,
and had taken up his studies. Papa answered,
giving him some friendly counsel, but we had
heard nothing since. Stuart had sent two chatty
epistles. Stephen was expected home every
week.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I ought to have gone to Wilburton
and looked after him;” papa would say
anxiously.</p>

<p>“You have been so very busy all the time
with your duties here;” mamma would reply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
reassuringly. “And Louis is one of those quietly
persistent young men who take their own way
and learn, if they ever do, from experience.”</p>

<p>I doubt if it would have made any difference
in what occurred. Fan used to say that we had
gentle showers of misfortune and rains of adversity,
and this must have been both combined.
The letter came from Stuart with the bad news,
which shocked us beyond description.</p>

<p>I will tell it more briefly than in his rambling,
commenting fashion. He had little of the brotherly
love that desires to cover up faults, or hide
the worst of any untoward incident.</p>

<p>Louis’ boarding place might have proved a
judicious home, but a month after his being settled
with Mrs. Fuller, a young clerk came to
share his comforts, one of those selfish, astute
persons as Stephen afterwards learned, who with
his pleasing address and flattering deference soon
won Louis’ regard and confidence, and introduced
him to some dangerous companions. This
was followed by late hours and gaming. To a
nervous, excitable nature these games of chance
with an occasional victory, became a dangerous
fascination. Louis was no match for his adversaries.
They looked upon him as a rich, hot-headed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
ignorant young fellow and drew him on
until he found himself heavily in debt. The
money sent for his current expenses was swallowed
up, and proved but a drop in the whirlpool.</p>

<p>One evening he had begun with the luck in
his favor and felt wonderfully elated. At midnight
he would fain have left them, but they
bantered him to stay, rather hinting that a
defection would be from basely selfish motives.
He was not to be dared and took his seat again,
losing heavily on the first play. The others had
been drinking and grown a trifle careless. He
was watching with eager, restless eyes and
detected to his surprise, a play so unusual that
it brought an instant conviction to his mind
that even his trusted friend might be in league
against him.</p>

<p>He mastered his indignation and went steadily
on, every sense alert with suspicion. Presently
the trick was repeated, his opponent winning
triumphantly. But his endurance came to
an end with this, and he burst forth in angry
vehemence, accusing everybody, and hurling passionate
epithets that roused the wrath of the
small circle, which they resented as warmly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
A bitter taunt cost Louis the last remnant of
self-control, and he flew at his adversary with a
tiger’s strength and quickness. One tremendous
blow ended the contest.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! Duncan, you have killed
him!” cried one of the party. “You’ll rue this
night’s work!”</p>

<p>His youth and his impulsiveness led him astray
again. Like a flash he beheld the disgrace, the
awful crime, the consternation of all who knew
him. Obeying his first unreasoning impulse he
fled from the place. Whither should he go?
Death would be preferable to arrest and scandal.</p>

<p>He had a small amount of money with him
and it was but a few steps to the station. The
train made a moment’s halt and he stepped on
board in the darkness. If he had waited until
morning it would have proved only a disgraceful
gambling brawl. The injured youth was brought
to consciousness and through the physician’s
efforts saved from congestion. A few day’s illness
would be the result to him, but the story
spread like wild-fire, exaggerated in every respect.
This was the account that came from
Stuart.</p>

<p>Papa was horror stricken at the first moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
He buried his face in his hands and gave the
letter to mother.</p>

<p>“Poor boy!” she said tenderly. “His unfortunate
temper, his distrust of those who would
have proved his best friends, and his credulity
in other respects, have made him an easy victim.
But what has become of him?”</p>

<p>“I must go immediately,” papa exclaimed.
“I am in some sense his keeper. I ought to
have looked after him before. Poor lad. How
we prayed for him to be spared last summer!
Perhaps—”</p>

<p>“Dear papa,” said Fan, “if God had not
thought best to save his life, he would have
been taken. Please do not blame yourself. It
was our duty to try, and to pray. The end
is with God.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my darling, and I must act
instead of doubting. Let me think—I can
reach Wilburton at eight this evening. I will
do all I can. If Stephen were only here!”</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward we received a telegram
from him. He was in New York. After a
flying visit to the boys he would be with us.</p>

<p>“I had better meet him there;” said papa.
“We can consult about the best steps to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
taken. And indeed, Louis may have returned
to Wilburton.</p>

<p>“Everything always does happen to us at once,”
said Fan. “But this is such a sorry happening!
We have to take our share of other’s misfortunes,
but joys do not always go round so far.”</p>

<p>“I am sure we have had a great many joys;”
returned mamma in her sweet tone. “And
no—”</p>

<p>“Bad boys of our own;” put in Fan. “Or
good ones either for that matter. But there <em>is</em>
one thing to be very thankful for, and that is,
that Louis Duncan has not the sin of murder
on his soul.”</p>

<p>“True, true, Fanny;” returned papa.</p>

<p>An hour later he put a few articles in a hand
satchel and bade us good-bye. That was Wednesday
and he did not return until Friday eve,
when Mr. Duncan came with him.</p>

<p>Six months of foreign life had changed him
considerably. He was stouter, looked older, and
wore a full beard. I <em>did</em> feel afraid of him.
I wondered how Fan could talk so freely. He
was grave to the verge of sadness; yet very
sweet to mamma with that kind of reverential
sweetness so touching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>The victim of the affray was out of danger.
Stephen had been investigating his brother’s
affairs, but found no extravagances beside the
gambling debts. Otherwise his course of conduct
had not been blamable. But there were no
tidings of him. Stephen had inserted advertisements
in one or two papers, begging him to
return, which was all that could be done for
the present.</p>

<p>The pleasure of the meeting was a good deal
dampened by this unfortunate affair. Mr. Duncan
had counted so much upon his visit to us,
it would seem. He brought mamma a lovely
black silk dress from Paris, Edith a necklace
and armlets that would make her pretty bracelets
by and by. For Fan a choice set of engravings
in a beautiful port-folio. Nelly some beautiful
handkerchiefs, and the children each a ring.</p>

<p>“And this is for you;” he said, handing me
a little box. “I have heard how good you
were to my poor brother, and though it is only
a trifle, I hope you will accept it and my
grateful thanks as well.”</p>

<p>It was a beautiful pearl cross in the most
delicate setting. So white and pure that I felt
half afraid of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“O,” I exclaimed confusedly, “I did not do
very much! I—mamma—thank you!” and I
turned away from his peculiar look.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I had brought a great deal of
trouble upon you all, but I will have no blame
attached to any one, least of all you, Mr. Endicott.
I know you have done your duty like a
Christian gentleman, like a father, indeed. It
is the poor boy’s misfortune that he is so self-willed
and ungovernable, and I must try, if
God spares me, to reclaim him. I was wrong
not to begin earlier.”</p>

<p>“If I can be of any assistance command me
to the utmost;” and papa wrung Stephen’s hand.
“It is my duty to search for the lost souls and
point out the way of repentance. I do feel that
I have been sadly remiss.”</p>

<p>That evening at twilight I was standing at
the study window glancing dreamily over the
snowy road, when I heard a step beside me. I
<em>felt</em> immediately who it was.</p>

<p>“I believe I owe you an apology,” he began
in a low tone. “You were disappointed in
your gift, and I do not wonder. I ought not
to have bought you a cross. I had already laid
one upon you unwittingly. Forgive me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“It was too elegant,” I returned. “That
was its only fault, if it had one. I was—obliged
for the kind remembrance.”</p>

<p>“But you will not like to wear it?”</p>

<p>I was silent, I could not tell why, but I
should <em>not</em> want to wear it.</p>

<p>“I never have had such a costly article;” I
faltered.</p>

<p>“Well, put it away, out of sight. I seem to
be unlucky—with you!”</p>

<p>His tone was almost impatient. He did not
go away and I remained awkwardly by his side.</p>

<p>Did some evil genius tempt me to say—</p>

<p>“I think you feel too hard and severe towards
Louis. You don’t know what it is to
have such a temper—”</p>

<p>“Thank God, no!” he interrupted.</p>

<p>“And he has never had one good true friend
in whom he could trust. He is peculiar and
sensitive.”</p>

<p>“I have made several attempts to win his
confidence and failed. I fancied perhaps, that
coming here might have some effect upon him.
It is terrible to think of his being hardened in
deceit and given over to violence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is not;” I cried impulsively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“Are you quite sure?”</p>

<p>Something in the tone offended me. I could
not say what I wished.</p>

<p>“At least you will forgive him—if he comes
back?”</p>

<p>“I can assure you he will not find me unbrotherly.
But he must learn that he is not
quite his own master.”</p>

<p>Nelly ran in. I was glad to go away and
leave him. And yet as we were all singing together
that evening, something in his voice
touched me, moved me to tears. How tender
he could be, and yet how stern.</p>

<p>I told mamma afterward of the talks Louis
and I had had. So far I had held them in
peculiar confidence. She was a little encouraged,
and we tried to hope for the best.</p>

<p>Stephen spent nearly a week with us. He
and Fan and Nelly agreed capitally. We went
over to the Churchill’s, and the ladies were
charmed with him. But he seemed so much
older to me than Dick Fairlie, and several of
the young villagers.</p>

<p>He took great pleasure in planning with
mamma.</p>

<p>The estate owned a rather old-fashioned house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
in the upper part of the city, which he meant
to repair and furnish, and set up house-keeping.
If he could find some nice, cheerful, refined
woman to take charge—did we know of anybody?</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Fan, “Mrs. Whitcomb! It
will be just magnificent! Only she shall not
come unless you promise her—let me see—three
vacations a year, to visit us.”</p>

<p>“A month at a time?”</p>

<p>“About that. We have the first claim. She
can do everything and is a lovely lady beside.
And she is pretty too.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly in her favor,” and he
laughed mischievously. “Could we find this
paragon?”</p>

<p>“She is at Oxford. If you were to invite
me to go sleigh-riding, we might;” said Fan
demurely.</p>

<p>“Fanny!” in mamma’s gentle tone.</p>

<p>“Miss Fanny, will you be kind enough to
accompany me to Oxford to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Duncan, I shall be happy
to;” and Fan made a sweeping curtsey.</p>

<p>They went off merrily in Mr. Fairlie’s dainty
cutter, saw Mrs. Whitcomb, with whom Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
Duncan was charmed. She promised to consider
the matter.</p>

<p>We missed him ever so much when he was
gone. Fan seemed odd and restless. Papa was
much engrossed with parish work, there being
a number of sick people, and at this season of
the year the wants of the poor became much
more numerous. Employment was duller in the
winter and after the poorer class had used up
their own subsistence, they became necessarily
somewhat dependent upon their neighbors. So
papa used to try and interest the richer ones in
their behalf. The season had been a pretty
severe one. Miss Churchill came over one morning
and he asked her assistance.</p>

<p>“I should be glad to do anything in my
power, Mr. Endicott,” she said. “Tell me how
to begin. For though I have given money, I
am learning to understand that something else
is needed.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “Most of these people
are honest and industrious and would work if
they could get it to do. Charity in its broad,
bold sense does mortify them.”</p>

<p>“I heard Kenton speaking of some woodland
he wanted cleared. One of our men went away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
in the fall and we have been rather short-handed.
Now if some one would undertake
it—”</p>

<p>“Just the thing,” interposed papa. “And—I
wanted to send the Widow Maxwell a barrel
of flour. She has nothing but potatoes in
the house, I know.”</p>

<p>“Make out a list and I will see what I can
do. We borrow Miss Fanny so often that I wish
to make all the return in my power. Lucy
enjoys her society so much.”</p>

<p>“And she gives me so much in return,” said
Fanny, warmly. “Why, I am getting to be
quite an artist. I may be tempted to accept
Miss Maynard’s offer after all.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>Fanny and I explained.</p>

<p>“I suppose it <em>is</em> a temptation for a young
girl to wish to distinguish herself. And yet—you
are all so happy here that I should be sorry
to see a break.”</p>

<p>“There will be none yet awhile,” replied
mamma. “I want my girls to learn some useful
home lessons first. I do not know but there
is as high and worthy an art in managing and
saving and in making happiness as in earning
money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“I think you are right, Mrs. Endicott.
While I admit the necessity of every woman
knowing something whereby she can support
herself, I sometimes wonder if the reformers are
not carrying the matter too far. Girls are painters
and poets and shop-keepers and teachers.
When they marry, housework is distasteful to
them. They do not know how to cook a dinner
or make a dress, they cannot carry on a
household in a pleasant, agreeable manner. They
must board or depend upon servants. There is
nothing but complaint and discouragement. They
may be valuable members of society, but their
time is too precious to be wasted upon real living.
Every year homes become more rare.”</p>

<p>“It is too sadly true,” said papa. “There is
a wide difference between a fashionable house
and a pleasant home. And home used to mean
something besides a place in which one slept
and took his meals.”</p>

<p>“But some women never marry and never
have a home,” interposed Fanny.</p>

<p>“There are exceptions. Yet many prefer the
other course. I know families of girls who
might have assisted and comforted their mothers,
but who went to neighboring towns or cities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
earning barely enough to keep themselves, sleeping
in miserable close attics when they could
have clean airy rooms at home, and exposed to
flippant injurious companionship that destroys
all the finer graces of a woman’s soul. Their
mother has to depend upon Irish help whose waste
and wages would doubtless dress two daughters.
She has no society at home and is worried out
of her life. What is it all for? Why can they
not make each other happy?”</p>

<p>“An imaginary liberty,” answered mamma.
“I want to make my home so pleasant that my
girls will be sorry to leave it. I hope to
instruct them in such a manner that they will
be able to make other happy homes, and then I
shall have no fear for them.”</p>

<p>“And when seven daughters rise up and call
you blessed, you will be overwhelmed, little
mother,” returned Fan clasping her arms around
mamma’s neck. “It is what we expect to do
by and by, when Edith is old enough to fill
out the row gracefully. Yet I do sometimes
feel appalled at the host to take care of. Clergymen
may abound in grace but they seldom
do in this world’s goods. We are not ravens,
nor lilies of the field.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“I think you will find it coming out rightly
in the end,” said Miss Churchill with a smile.
“Your mother’s theories may not be like the
modern ones, but very good women were reared
under them, and they are not quite out of date.
I would like to see them put in practise oftener.”</p>

<p>Fan blushed vividly at the beginning of Miss
Churchill’s sentence. I wondered a little why?</p>

<p>“And now I must go,” declared Miss Churchill
rising. “I always get fascinated when I come
here, and stay beyond reasonable limits. When
your charming nest becomes over-crowded, Mrs.
Endicott, I will be glad to take one birdie.
You won’t forget the list, Mr. Endicott?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I shall be thankful for so good
a helper.”</p>

<p>“And now good-bye till I come again,” said
she.</p>

<p>We awaited the first letter from Stephen
Duncan anxiously. There were no tidings of
Louis, and he was feeling very much alarmed.
He had inspected the house and was to begin
repairs immediately. It was his intention to
have a home for himself and his brothers, and
to do his duty by them, with God’s help, in-so-far
as he could. “And wherein I do succeed,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
he wrote, “the work will be in a great measure
due to your Christian counsel and solicitude.
I shall always esteem it one of the fortunate
steps of my life that I came to you, my dear
friend, when I needed fatherly advice.”</p>

<p>February was dull and dreary, though we had
little time to think of it. Not one busy bee
could have been spared from the hive. Miss
Churchill called ours a co-operative home, and
I think it was. News came to Mr. Fairlie that
his mother and sister had decided to go to
Europe with a pleasant party. They would
return to New York in April and sail in May.</p>

<p>“So I can look out for myself,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Why do you not go with them?” asked
Fan.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t enjoy it if I did—to travel
round with a parcel of women. Now if one
could go with a man like Mr. Duncan!”</p>

<p>“That would be just perfection,” she returned
eagerly.</p>

<p>He glanced at her in a peculiar manner.
Something flashed across my mind at that instant.
They liked each other very much. He was
hurrying to get his house in order—Mrs. Whitcomb
would be there—yes, it would all come
around right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>It came faster than any one expected. The first
week in March we were surprised by a visit
from him. He had commenced furnishing and
was in a quandary.</p>

<p>“And so I have come to consult, and to ask
a tremendous favor of you, Mrs. Endicott,” he
said. “I have gained Mrs. Whitcomb’s consent
to come in company with you and see how she
would like it. I want you and Miss Fanny and
my little god-daughter to go back with me next
week, and we will have a kind of family party.
I have my dining-room and two guest-chambers
furnished, though they want a woman’s graceful
fingers to add some final touches. And now
like Benedick ‘I will hear of nothing to the
contrary.’”</p>

<p>Mamma said at first it was quite impossible.
Fan I could see was strongly in favor of the idea.
I knew that I could keep house very well, and
it would be delightful to have them go. So we
talked and talked. Mrs. Whitcomb came over
and the matter was actually settled.</p>

<p>Stephen had found some trace of Louis and
lost it again, but he was confident that he could
follow up the clue. He had grown exceedingly
anxious. He and papa had long talks on the
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>“I heard of his keeping books for a few
weeks at a factory,” he explained. “I think he
must have gone away nearly destitute, but this
effort at independence gives me much hope.
Perhaps it will be a good lesson for him—if he
does not fall among evil associates.”</p>

<p>It was nothing but Stephen and Mr. Duncan.
I began to grow almost jealous. Did he suspect
it, I wonder? He used to watch me so
curiously, though somehow we never talked.
He and Fan were absolutely jolly. I wondered
how she dared be so saucy with that great
grave-eyed man.</p>

<p>“You won’t mind being left alone for a little
while?” he said to me. “I will promise to
take excellent care of your mother. I only wish
it were a pleasanter season of the year, but Miss
Fanny will keep us bright anywhere.”</p>

<p>That was true enough.</p>

<p>“And if I can induce Mrs. Whitcomb to stay
I shall be quite satisfied with my lot.”</p>

<p>Indeed, I think any one might have been satisfied
with the prospect before him.</p>

<p>We said good-bye to them on Monday morning,
as mamma decided that she must be at
home by Saturday. I could not realize that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
they had gone for more than the day until
evening set in. Then it seemed so strange and
quiet. There was a little drizzle of hail and
rain, and for a wonder no one dropped in.
The children went to bed, Nelly was busy with
her studies, papa read, and I sewed some trifle.
I believe I felt nervous and almost low-spirited.</p>

<p>“Come,” I said to myself, “this will never
do.”</p>

<p>But I did have a little quiet cry when I went
to bed. The house would never be the same
without Fan. I should miss her so much.</p>

<p>I felt better the next day and went at my
work cheerfully. About noon it cleared away
bright and crisp.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said papa, “could you go down to
old Mrs. Aitkens’ this afternoon? She is very
poorly and may want something done.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered quickly. I would give
moping no place to settle itself to-day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elsden came in after dinner and staid
quite awhile, to cheer me up, she said. If I
was lonesome Addie should come over and spend
the day with me.</p>

<p>“I would be glad to see Addie,” I said, “but
I should be too busy to get lonesome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Then as I was going right by Jennie Ryder’s
I remembered a book she wanted, so I decided
to call. She and her mother sat in their
cheerful parlor, as cosy as you please. I took
the chair beside hers and there right in the edge
of her pretty willow work-stand lay a gentleman’s
glove with her needle in it. Our eyes
fell on it at the same moment. She blushed
and tucked it out of sight, and then the next
instant drew it forth with an odd deliberateness
and went on mending the rips.</p>

<p>I laughed a little, so did she.</p>

<p>“Richard left his gloves here last evening;”
she said. “He has no one to look after such
matters now.”</p>

<p>“He will have quite a trial of loneliness,” I
answered. “Mrs. Fairlie and Kate expect to be
in Europe two years or more. Kate will have
her darling wish.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t know what he would do if
you were not so good to him at the Rectory.”</p>

<p>“But we do not mend his gloves,” I said
teasingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is—nothing;” but she blushed
again.</p>

<p>There was a vase of choice flowers on one
window-sill, and I went to inspect it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I did not know you had an azalea,”
I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>“I have not. They—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fairlie brought them over,” said Mrs.
Ryder gravely. “He comforts himself with
flowers and birds and kittens. Harmless dissipation
for a young man.”</p>

<p>I felt mischievous enough to add,—“And Jennie,”
but delicacy forbade me. But I <em>was</em> pleased.
If ever anybody deserved a good husband it was
Jennie Ryder.</p>

<p>Then I went on to Mrs. Aitkens’. She kept
me until dusk. I was hurrying home in the
cold March twilight and had just passed the
Church when some one from across the street
paused and eyed me sharply. It was not a
familiar face I thought, and went on. The person
came over which made me quicken my
steps.</p>

<p>“Miss Rose,” a voice said huskily, “Miss Endicott!”</p>

<p>I turned and stood an instant, speechless with
surprise. When I could get my breath I held
out both hands and said—“Oh, Louis Duncan!”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t quite—hate the sight of
me?”</p>
<br>

<p>“If you only knew,” I answered eagerly.—“If
you <em>could</em> know how anxious every one has
felt, and how thankful we all are that you are
alive! O, come home with me!”</p>

<p>“Thankful! I had better be dead! But I
am not.”</p>

<p>He was very thin and pale, and had a worn,
tired look. My heart ached for him.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “it is better that you are alive.
Stephen has been searching for you. He was
here last week.”</p>

<p>Louis turned deadly pale at that.</p>

<p>“Come,” I urged.</p>

<p>“I have been haunting your house all the
afternoon. I thought I should have to go without
seeing you. You have heard—of course.”</p>

<p>“Everything, I believe.”</p>

<p>“I know how Stephen feels. His life has
been so perfect! His temper is angelic! And
yet Rose—I <em>did</em> mean to do better. I resolved—”</p>

<p>“In your own strength;” I said softly. “God
let you see how weak that was. And yet you
must not be cast down. Even Christians have
to try many times. But there <em>is</em> the promise.
And God saves to the uttermost, to the fartherest
weakness, the blackest sin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“I was <em>so</em> angry. I just understood how they
had been cheating me all along, and what a
fool I had been. They added taunts and insults.
I struck out blindly and madly, not caring.
<em>Was</em> it God who saved me from the commission
of an awful crime? I fled thinking myself a
murderer. I hid in lanes and byways for three
miserable days, knowing how Cain felt when he
said his punishment was greater than he could
bear. If Kelsey had died I think I should have
thrown myself into the river. Then I saw in a
paper that he had been only temporarily injured.
The affair was headed—‘A gambling brawl,’
and even though I felt relieved, the disgrace
stung me so keenly.”</p>

<p>“But it has been forgotten by this time. And
Stephen means that you shall stay with him for
some months at least. You can redeem all the
past. Oh, try.” I pleaded earnestly.</p>

<p>“Tell me about Stephen?” he said tremulously.</p>

<p>I went briefly over the incidents of his return,
but I did lay great stress upon Stephen’s anxiety,
his willingness to forgive the past, for I knew he
would be less severe now than a month ago.
I pictured the home, and the pleasure there
might be for both in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>“And your sister is there,” he replied in an
odd tone of voice that was more comment than
inquiry.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Did he guess? “Oh,” I said, “it
may be—perhaps it is wrong for me to hint it—but
he likes her very much.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” this time almost harshly. “I understand.
She is pretty and bright, and good—but
I wish it were you instead. I thought you
liked him. You used to take his part. Oh,
Rose, if you were to be there I believe I should
go. If you were my sister you might save me.
You are so sweet, so patient; you know so
many tender ways.”</p>

<p>“Why, I should be your sister then,” I said,
trembling in shame and confusion, for what,
I hardly knew.</p>

<p>“You are so different from most people. I
think Stephen would be gentler with you—”</p>

<p>“Hush, he knows best. Come home with me
and talk to papa. What have you been doing
all this while?”</p>

<p>“Earning my living for a change,” and he
laughed bitterly. “I <em>can</em> go West. Not that I
mean to relinquish my fortune, but since I have
disgraced them all—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“No, no;” I rejoined firmly. “You must
not go.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Return to Stephen directly. Redeem the past
with a brave, true, upright manhood. You <em>can</em>
do it. I do not believe you will ever be tempted
in that way again.”</p>

<p>“You are right there. If you could know
how I <em>have</em> governed myself during the past
two months. I feel as if half my temper was
gone,—since that awful night. But to go back—to
humble myself to him—”</p>

<p>“Have you not hurt his pride cruelly?” I
said.</p>

<p>Louis was silent.</p>

<p>“Oh, please <em>do</em> go for my sake,” I entreated.
“Let papa—”</p>

<p>“No,” hoarsely. “I couldn’t talk to any one
but you. I was wild to see you. I wanted to
know what you thought—if I was past redemption—”</p>

<p>“No, you are not. You do not understand
how some of these very faults may be transformed
into virtues. Is it not braver to struggle than
to give up like a coward in despair.”</p>

<p>“I never <em>was</em> cowardly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“Prove your bravery by going to Stephen.
Start anew. God will give you strength and
grace. I know you can succeed.”</p>

<p>He glanced at me long and earnestly. There
was a strange wistfulness in his face that
touched me.</p>

<p>“Promise!” I took his cold hand in mine.</p>

<p>“No, I cannot—quite. I must think of it.
And I must go, also, I have kept you too long
in the cold.”</p>

<p>“But where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I shall take the train at seven;” evasively.</p>

<p>I pleaded again, warmly, earnestly. I fancied
that I saw tears in his eyes, but he would
not promise me positively.</p>

<p>We said a lingering good-bye in the starlight.
I felt assured that he must come to a better
sense of the matter.</p>

<p>Then I hurried home. They were through
supper. Papa was putting on his overcoat.</p>

<p>“I was just coming for you. Why how—excited
you look! Is Mrs. Aitken worse?”</p>

<p>“No, I have been walking rapidly.”</p>

<p>“Let me pour your tea;” began Nelly. “I
was head of the table, and felt quite grand.”</p>

<p>I tried to be composed. I had promised not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
to say a word about the meeting, but it seemed
strange to have such an important secret in my
keeping.</p>

<p>Before I went to bed that night I wrote to
Stephen. I never could remember what I said,
for I sealed the letter without reading it over,
and sent it when Nelly went to school. But I
begged him to be patient and merciful to Louis.</p>

<p>Nothing else of importance happened in my
week of house-keeping. Thursday evening we
received a letter from Fan that was sketchy and
funny and incoherent. I felt that she must
really be in love. How strangely the links of
life join, I said to myself.</p>

<p>We were glad enough to get them home on
Saturday afternoon. Edith had a slight cold,
but Fan was bright and rosy and glowing in
her descriptions. She had never had such fun
in her life. They had bought carpets, furniture,
pictures, ornaments; the Duncan family silver
was wonderful to behold, and the house delightful,
just old fashioned enough not to be grand.
Mrs. Whitcomb was installed house-keeper and
was as much in love with Stephen as everybody
else. We were all to make visits as often
as we could, and during vacation he meant to
have the whole family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>He sent papa a set of new books which were
just what he had been wishing for.</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Nelly, “it will be splendid
to go to New York like everybody else. Children,
we must begin to save our money.”</p>

<p>“Are there any tidings of Louis?” I asked
with my heart in my throat.</p>

<p>“No. Mr. Duncan intends to begin a search
himself next week. He is resolved to find him.”</p>

<p>After supper papa came round to Fanny and
played with her golden hair and watched her as
she talked. How much he loved her! Did he
feel that there might be a rival ere long, a
break in the chain of girls? Yet she seemed so
gladly, so unconsciously happy.</p>

<p>It was the children’s bed time at last. They
kissed round and round as if they were never to
see anybody again. I had to hurry them finally,
their good night was so lingering.</p>

<p>“Fanny,” papa said, “will you come in my
study a few moments.”</p>

<p>She put her hand over his shoulder, and his
arm was around her waist. I saw them cross
the hall, making such a pretty picture that I
smiled. Then the door shut.</p>

<p>This was what happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>They walked together to the library table.
Papa took up a letter, fingered it idly and studied
Fan’s sweet young face.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to speak of this until Monday,”
he began, “but I have a feeling that it
may be best finished at once. I received a letter
a few days ago,—in which there was an enclosure
for you—this.”</p>

<p>He took out a folded paper and handed it to
her. She opened it wonderingly. Out fell a
faded rose with two or three buds.</p>

<p>She gave a low cry and hid her face on papa’s
shoulder. He smoothed the golden hair and
presently said in a tremulous tone—</p>

<p>“Will you read my letter? I should like to
have you.”</p>

<p>She raised her scarlet face, still keeping her
eyes averted. It was some seconds before she
could begin to distinguish the words.</p>

<p>A manly straight-forward appeal to papa from
Winthrop Ogden. He confessed to having spoken
hastily in the summer, and promising to wait
long enough to convince Miss Endicott that he
was in earnest. His mind had not wavered
from that hour, and now he asked papa’s permission
to visit her and try his fate, convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
that his love was loyal and earnest. His family
admired Miss Endicott, and such an engagement
would meet with their approval, he knew.
Might he hope for an answer soon?</p>

<p>“My darling!”</p>

<p>“Oh papa!” and the fair head went down
again.</p>

<p>“Shall I send this young interloper about his
business?”</p>

<p>There was no answer except as the soft arms
crept up round his neck.</p>

<p>“My dear child, what is it?” finding a little
place in the forehead to kiss.</p>

<p>“Can I—do—” and the faltering voice paused.</p>

<p>“Just as you like, my darling. While I
should be sorry to give you—to another,” and
there was a pathetic little break in the voice;
“still the young man <em>is</em> unexceptionable. I
believe the Churchills would welcome you
warmly. And marrying and being given in
marriage is the way of the world.”</p>

<p>“Then—papa—” and the remainder of the
answer was a long, tender kiss.</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps—Stephen Duncan—”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, he doesn’t love me—in that way.</p>

<p>“But I know his secret, that is I once saw it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
gleam out like a tiny snow-drop in the sun. I
am not to be the only happy girl in the world.”</p>

<p>Papa looked a little puzzled, then he sighed.</p>

<p>“Why,” said he dolorously—“there will be
only five left!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> seemed so strange the next day to look
at Fan and think what had happened to
her. I was glad to have it Sunday. The
very church bells appeared to have caught a
deeper tone, an awe and sacredness, a being set
apart as it were from the ordinary uses. It was
sweet and beautiful to me, and I was filled with
a kind of quiet excitement, a great throbbing
and trembling in every nerve, as if I stood on
the threshold of a new life. Other girls had
been engaged or had lovers, but it did not enter
into my soul like this.</p>

<p>She was sweet and dreamy, saying very little.
When she sang in Church her voice had a
peculiar tremulousness in it, as if it swept
through great waves of feeling. Mamma was
very tender to her. When their eyes met it
was with a mutual understanding made manifest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
in the simplest glance. I did not feel jealous.
She and papa surely had the first right to the
mystery and blessedness of the new relation.
Papa watched her with wistful eyes, as if he
could hardly resolve to relinquish her.</p>

<p>Thus two or three days passed. We were up
in our room, I dusting, and Fan folding some
clothes, and laying ribbons orderly in a pretty
box.</p>

<p>“That is so lovely,” and she shook out a
delicate blonde blue. “Mr. Duncan chose it
for me. We went shopping one day with Mrs.
Whitcomb, to buy some table linen. It was
such fun! I told him he wasted his money in
riotous living, the fine linen being a sure sign.”</p>

<p>Just then our heads met, mine going down
and hers coming up. We laughed and looked
at each other in great confusion.</p>

<p>“O Fan,” I said just under my breath.</p>

<p>“My dear old darling! I want to tell you—”</p>

<p>“I have guessed,” I said quickly with conscious
color. “It is just right, you and Stephen will
be so happy.”</p>

<p>“Stephen!” and she looked at me in surprise.
“And papa thought so too!” at which
she laughed gayly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it Stephen?” in blank amazement.</p>

<p>“Why, no, and mamma has not even hinted?”</p>

<p>“It cannot be Dick Fairlie,” I said wonderingly.
“I am sure Jennie—”</p>

<p>“O you little goose! Now as there is just
one other man left in the world you can surely
guess.”</p>

<p>I looked at her with that peculiar mental
blindness where one may see, but the thought
is shaped to nothing.</p>

<p>“It is not—Winthrop Ogden.”</p>

<p>A great rift of scarlet rushed over her face.
Her eyes were luminous with the dewiness of joy
that misses tears, and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>“Oh Fanny!”</p>

<p>I could only take her in my arms and kiss
her.</p>

<p>“He wrote to papa. He cared more than we
thought. And there was—I did not tell you
about the rose then. I felt afraid that he <em>was</em>
trifling with me. And somehow—”</p>

<p>I understood it all when she did tell me in
her sweet halting way. A faint glimmering of
love, or what might be love if there was truth
for a foundation stone.</p>

<p>“Are you quite certain that Stephen—?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>“Oh you dear, tender heart! Yes, quite sure
that he does not love me only in a friendly fashion.
We suit, and can talk of everything. He
will not be so with the woman he loves—at
first.”</p>

<p>“But it is so—queer;” and I smiled reflectively.</p>

<p>“Yes. We are not engaged, you know. He
only asked for the privilege of coming honorably.
I thought he would wait a year—but he has
not.”</p>

<p>“He is earnest, if impatient.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I believe I like the imperiousness.”</p>

<p>We went down stairs presently, Papa came
in with a letter.</p>

<p>“For you, little woman;” he said, looking
curiously at me.</p>

<p>I did not wonder at that. It was in Mr.
Duncan’s hand, and of course he was surprised
at Mr. Duncan writing to <em>me</em>. But I knew all
about it and broke open the seal hurriedly. It
was very brief.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear, Dear Friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em">Louis came to me on Sunday evening.</span>
I understand how much of the good work has been yours, and
have no words to thank you as I ought. God bless you,
always. Louis is quite ill. With love to you and yours.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">S. Duncan.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>I handed it to papa, saying—</p>

<p>“I shall have to tell you the story, first. I
have had a secret since last week, but I could
not help it.”</p>

<p>“God be thanked for restoring this last son.
Now what is it, Rose?”</p>

<p>I related the particulars of our meeting, and
how I had urged Louis to return, but that being
bound by a promise of secrecy, I could only wait
the result.</p>

<p>“You were quite right;” replied papa. “The
good seed has not been utterly wasted. I have
great hopes for this young man, after all. Perhaps
just this shock was needed to bring him
to his senses. Peculiar natures need peculiar
discipline.”</p>

<p>“How brave and good you are in your quiet
way Rose.” Fan said with her arms around my
neck.</p>

<p>I could not see what particular bravery there
was in it. It had just happened. The work
had come to my hand, and I could not have
turned away.</p>

<p>“I am so glad Mrs. Whitcomb is there;” began
mamma thoughtfully. “It seems a special
providence. She has so much wisdom and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
patience, she can look beyond the little to-day,
to the great end. She does not show you how
weak and miserable you are, but raises you up
to her strength, lends it to you, as it were,
until you have some of your own.”</p>

<p>Then we went our ways again a shade more
grave, perhaps, but with a secret joy in our
hearts over the “one sinner.” Just now we did
not need to remember the ninety and nine just
ones.</p>

<p>The next event was a letter from Mr. Ogden
to papa. He expected to make a flying visit at
the West Side, and would take great pleasure
in calling.</p>

<p>He reached the village late Saturday afternoon,
and came over in the evening. He and
papa and Fan had a talk in the study, and then
they spent an hour by themselves. Fan looked
bright and funny when she came up stairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear little grandmother;” she
began, “how nice it is to have some one to
confess to, when you feel foolish and half sentimental.
If you want to laugh at me you can,
there is no law in the Constitution to forbid it.
I am not very far gone in love yet, but I
expect to be some day. Meanwhile, let us be
sensible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>“I have not the slightest objection;” said I
gayly.</p>

<p>“I will make my last will and testament while
I am of sound mind, then. Or rather part of
this is papa’s. We are not to be really engaged
before Autumn, and in the meanwhile we are
to find out on how many points we agree. But
Mr. Ogden is in desperate earnest.”</p>

<p>“You do not seem to be.”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know what I am. I have
been tumbled up and down in my mind and lost
my mental equilibrium. But Rose, to think of
Winthrop that very evening telling his Aunt
Lucy! And I have been there time and again,
never suspecting it. She has been very sweet
to me.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, only they are rich, and grand
as people say, and I feel quite small beside
them. He doesn’t mean to tell his mother just
yet, but the rest of the family are—glad that
it is so. But when his Aunt Lucy wrote about
Mr. Duncan being here he was in a flame at
once. He spoke last summer because he was
jealous of Dick Fairlie, and now because he
was jealous of Mr. Duncan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>“Do you like that?” I inquired gravely.</p>

<p>“Well—” reflectively, tying her hair ribbon
around the pin-cushion, and going off a step to
view it, as if the becomingness of that was the
great point for consideration—“yes, I suppose it
<em>is</em> best. He thinks so. I do believe I have a
slight penchant for—flirting. It is abominable
in a clergyman’s daughter! Somehow I do not
believe the old Adam has been entirely eradicated
in my case. I shall have to go on fighting
it awhile longer. And so—if I <em>know</em> he is
watching me and will be made miserable over
it, I <em>shall</em> be more thoughtful.”</p>

<p>“But if you love him—?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the love—it is the bits of fun that
crop out now and then, and when I laugh,
somebody thinks it means something, when it
does not. I could not help about Dick, and I
was very sorry. I am so glad he has taken to
Jennie Ryder. And I <em>know</em> Mr. Duncan never
had a thought about marrying me. But it <em>is</em>
best to be careful, since there are men in the
world.”</p>

<p>“I think you had better come to bed,” I
rejoined, much amused at her.</p>

<p>“I suppose I had. Good-bye, moralizing. ‘Be
good and you will be happy.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>But she came and kissed me with rare tenderness.</p>

<p>Mr. Ogden walked home from church with
us on Sunday, and came to tea in the evening.
He was very bright and gracious and made the
children like him.</p>

<p>After this they were to correspond until midsummer,
when they would meet again.</p>

<p>There was another embarrassment to be gone
through with. A few days afterward Miss
Churchill came over. Obeying her first impulse,
Fan ran away with blushing cheeks. Mamma
and Miss Churchill had a good long talk to themselves.
But after awhile Fan was compelled to
make her appearance.</p>

<p>“My dear child;” and Miss Churchill just took
her in her arms and kissed her. “We all think
it very delightful to have a claim upon you.”</p>

<p>The tears sprang to Fan’s eyes. It was sweet
indeed to be so warmly welcomed. Mamma was
a little touched by it, too.</p>

<p>“I was very much surprised, and I scolded
Lucy roundly for keeping the secret from me.
But if we had chosen we could not have suited
ourselves better. And now, my dear, go get
yourself ready, for I am going to take you home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
with me and keep you all night. Lucy is wild
to see you.”</p>

<p>Fanny looked at mamma who nodded assent,
so she left us rather lingeringly.</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Endicott,” and Miss Churchill
came around, laying her hand on mamma’s shoulder,
“I think if I have ever envied any one in
the world, it is you, since I have come to know
you thoroughly. These charming girls growing
up beside you should be a crown of content to
any woman.”</p>

<p>“I have been very happy with my husband
and children;” and mamma’s eyes glistened.</p>

<p>“Circumstances shut me out of such hopes.
I suppose we all have our little romances in
youth. I too have had a pleasant life, and my
sister has needed my care, so that I do not feel
wasted;” and she smiled. “But I think I was
in danger of making my life rather too narrow.
We need something fresh and different from
ourselves. Even we who have the strength to
stand alone, like the sweet, tender sense of a
trailing vine reaching towards our hearts. A
breath out of some other living which enters
into or demands our sympathy makes us so much
more of kin to the whole world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed it does,” replied mamma warmly.
“When you learn to give and to take out of
each other’s sphere and experience, the actual
richness and breadth of existence is made manifest.”</p>

<p>“You have managed to get so much of real
sympathy and heartiness into your girls’ souls.
They are natural. There is no aiming at any
superiority. They will always go into beautiful
places because they fit just like a statue in some
niche. I cannot tell you what a pleasure Fanny
has been to us. I do not think Kenton is as
fond of Helen, way down in the depths of his
heart, though we always had to coax her into
our lives, and alter the niches a little. So we
are doubly glad to have her.”</p>

<p>It was such a sweet, heart-felt welcome that
the tears positively did come to mamma’s eyes
this time.</p>

<p>“Thank you a thousand times for your cordiality;”
she murmured with a great tremble in
her voice.</p>

<p>“Winthrop is very young, but the Churchill
blood is loyal to the last drop. I think he will
be true as steel through any probation. And
since they can have only one spring-time, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
glad season of bright, eager, joyous youth, we
will all try to keep out the thorns and let them
ramble to the very mountain tops if they so
elect. I dare say you fancy me a foolish old
woman!”</p>

<p>I thought her just splendid! Fan would be
rich in love on every side.</p>

<p>“They are both young,” returned mamma.
“Mr. Endicott considers it best that there should
be no formal engagement for the present, but I
feel as if it was quite a settled matter.”</p>

<p>“You must not become jealous if we should
monopolize her a great deal. She is such a
comfort to Lucy, with her bright engaging ways.
And I seem to be almost sharing your bliss of
motherhood.”</p>

<p>Fan returned just then fairly bewitching in
her new timidity. We kissed all round, and
they drove away. I took up my sewing, but
the house seemed strangely still.</p>

<p>“Rose, dear,” mamma began presently, “this
will bring a sense of lonesomeness to you that
may be depressing at first. I had hoped the
circle would not be broken quite so soon. But
you must be a brave little girl.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I replied, “I am happy because she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
is. And then she will not leave us for ever so
long. But she is so bright and pretty that some
one would have fallen in love with her if it had
not been Mr. Ogden. You will not be robbed
of me so soon—if that is any comfort.”</p>

<p>She smiled a little but did not answer.</p>

<p>The affection and honoring seemed to render
Fan more humble than before. She possessed
a truly rich and noble nature which would not
be easily puffed up with pride.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairlie and Kate returned, and a few
days afterward we heard that Mrs. Ogden was
at her brother’s.</p>

<p>Kate came over to see us. She had changed
indescribably. A languid society air enveloped
her as a garment. She talked with a slight
drawl, pronouncing her words in a very clear,
delicate manner, as if she was afraid of hurting
them, Nelly said. All except the r’s, which she
rather ignored.</p>

<p>The months spent at the South had been just
lovely. Such charming people, (“cha<em>w</em>ming”
she said,) so much cultivation, elegant, refined
manners, and oh, such dressing! How any one
could exist in this dull little town she did not
see. And the stay in New York had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
splendid! They had become very intimate with
Mrs. Ogden. We had seen Winthrop, of course.
Didn’t we think him a most entertaining young
man? She forgot though that we had but a
<em>very</em> slight opportunity of judging. He had
spent a number of evenings with her, and they
had been out together. He was quite an eligible
“parti,” with a strong French accent. The
whole Churchill estate would have to be divided
between him and his sister presently, since there
were only old maids and old bachelors in the
family. But she should not make up her mind
about marrying until after she had been abroad.
American girls often married very handsomely in
foreign countries.</p>

<p>“French Counts for instance,” said Fan.</p>

<p>“O, but the <em>real</em> article was to be had. And
American gentlemen traveled abroad now instead
of going to native watering places. It was so
much more stylish. If Dick only would go with
them! Mother had tried to persuade him to
hire the farm out.”</p>

<p>“He must be very lonesome;” said mamma.</p>

<p>“O, he is such an old hermit! He doesn’t
care at all for society. Just give him a book,
or a dog, or a lot of kittens and he is perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
happy. He will end by being a bachelor
like Mr. Churchill, yet I don’t know as that is
altogether to be deplored. Since mamma has a
life right there, it will be as well if there is no
wife to interfere.”</p>

<p>She said this with the utmost complacency. I
do not suppose she imagined that it had a selfish
sound.</p>

<p>Fan laughed a little afterward. “I shall tell
Winthrop that he had better wait. She <em>might</em>
come home from Europe and marry him.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe they will like Jennie Ryder;”
I remarked.</p>

<p>“Kate snubbed her long ago. But Dick and
she will have a chance to get settled, I think,
without any one’s interference. It is really
fortunate that they are going.”</p>

<p>We saw Mrs. Ogden twice during her stay.
She was not as lovely as Miss Esther, being
more worldly-minded, but she had the Churchill
breeding and was a lady.</p>

<p>There was one little feast that we kept by
ourselves—baby’s birthday. She could walk
and began to utter pretty words with one syllable
left off, and was the quaintest, cunningest
baby in the wide world as we knew—very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>“What a short year;” said Fanny. “How
many things have been crowded into it.”</p>

<p>“And we are glad to have you, dear little
Dot, if there are seven of us,” exclaimed Nelly,
kissing her extravagantly.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Duncan said he owned her and that
he meant to take her away some day;” declared
tiny Tim, who was fast outgrowing her pet
name. It seemed to me that they were all a
great deal taller than a year ago.</p>

<p>“We won’t let him have her just yet,” answered
papa. “Or perhaps some one might go
in her place.”</p>

<p>The children glanced at each other in dismay;
and papa laughed heartily.</p>

<p>The birds began to sing and the trees were
coming out again. We went to the woods for
wild flowers and had our house fragrant with
them. But in the wake of spring came house-cleaning
and gardening, and then—all the sewing.</p>

<p>“The same thing year after year;” I said to
mamma.</p>

<p>“And yet not quite the same either. There
is a gradual outgrowing and ingrowing. There
should be a corresponding strength and sweetness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
and patience and faith. By and by we
come to the whole stature. But it is the growth
of a good many springs, the heat and toil and
watching of many summers, and the ripening
of repeated autumns.”</p>

<p>“I did not take it as high as that.”</p>

<p>“But are we not to?” and mamma’s face was
at its sweetest. “I often think we work, in
types. We clean our houses and dust finds lodgement
in them again, we purify our souls by
prayer and good works, and we find the rubbish
of indolence and impatience and selfishness. So
we go at it and have another trial.”</p>

<p>“We ought to get strong;” I said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“We <em>do</em> grow stronger, I hope. And we become
more watchful over our work. You know
when our house is first made nice and tidy how
careful we are of littering it again. And when
God has helped us by his grace to purify our
souls how earnestly we should try to keep them
so. For they are His temples.”</p>

<p>I thought it over by myself. Yes, everything
spoke. The true meanings of life were not so
hard to get at, after all. It was—believe and
do. They went hand in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>And yet it was a curious jumble. You had
to come back from the grand thoughts to the
common every-day doings. Dresses and skirts
and aprons, sheets and towels, washing and ironing,
and the inevitable eating. The charm lay
in making it as good and as pretty as possible,
with the outside harmony of taste and appropriateness,
and the minor graces of love and kindness.</p>

<p>Fan had taken upon herself some new, odd
ways. She began to grow very motherly with the
children, she spent a part of every day in the
kitchen with Ann, and she had a box in one
corner of the bureau-drawer with which she
held mysterious consultations. Wonderful were
the patterns of tatting that went into it, the
bits of fine crocheting, the puffs and rufflings
gathered and stitched in dainty fashionings.</p>

<p>For her there could be no expensive trousseau
ordered at some first class city store. It would
have to be a labor of love and necessity.</p>

<p>She was quite demure and precise for awhile,
then Harry Denham came home from the West,
and she broke out into a regular frolic. Nothing
very bad or harmful, but her olden self that
could not be altogether repressed. Mamma came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
in with a guiding hand, and I think she understood
that she was being led over a dangerous
place. Oh, wise and tender mothers, what should
we do without you?</p>

<p>I went to Mrs. Ryder’s one afternoon to tea,
Jennie had asked me specially on Sunday.
“Come early,” she said, “so that we can have
a nice talk while mother is taking her rest.”</p>

<p>I could imagine what we were to talk about.
Jennie kissed me with a sweet, earnest tenderness,
seated me in a low chair by the window
and began to take off my hat, and shawl.</p>

<p>“Your mother is not any worse?” I began
by way of getting into the common-places of
talk before we should feel awkward.</p>

<p>“O no. Indeed I think she improves a little.
She walks better than she did.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad of that.”</p>

<p>“Not that she will ever regain the entire use
of her limbs. That would be too great a hope.
But it is so nice to have her even this way. I
sometimes think how lonely and forlorn I should
have been without one dear friend of my very
own.”</p>

<p>“I could not spare any one,” I returned,
looking away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“And you have so many.”</p>

<p>At that I smiled a little.</p>

<p>“A year or so ago mamma used to worry a
great deal in her sweet way that was not
actual complaining, about being such a burthen.
She thought it was dreadful to have all my
plans brought to nought, when I loved teaching
so much. And sometimes I could not see
just why that misfortune had to happen to me.”</p>

<p>“It is clearer now.”</p>

<p>“The way is clearer,—yes. But it is only
lately that I have understood the great truth.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you were always patient and good-tempered.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there something still higher than that,
or wider, maybe? We do not live to ourselves,
after all, or we ought not.”</p>

<p>“No;” I returned a little wonderingly, studying
the bright thoughtful face.</p>

<p>“The knowledge came—with something else.
Every day there is a new unfolding. And I
wanted to tell you—”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled and the sweet eyes were
downcast, while a soft flush crept up to her
temples.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jennie, we guessed—and we are all so
glad. It is about Richard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Here I was in the midst of another confidence.</p>

<p>“I wanted you to come alone to-day so that
we might talk it over. It is not that I love
Fan any less.”</p>

<p>It was my turn to blush now. I did it with a
sense of pain and shame. As if she divined my
distress, she said—</p>

<p>“Richard told me about the day last summer.
He did love Fanny very much—he loves her
still in one way. But he understands how different
their natures are.”</p>

<p>“That is just it;” I exclaimed with a sense
of relief.</p>

<p>“She wants some one to guide and strengthen
her, to be tender, and yet self-assertive. I do
not believe she could ever have made the <em>best</em>
of Richard. And I love to teach. I like the
unfolding, the evolving, something to <em>do</em>, beside
living straight along and enjoying one’s self.
And Richard needs to go to school. That is
nothing derogatory to him.”</p>

<p>“No. It is because he has had a rather repressed
life. No one cared for the things which
pleased him, except his father.”</p>

<p>“And the woman who takes it ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
spend all her energy in making it blossom, in
bringing it to its best and richest fruitage.”</p>

<p>“As you will.”</p>

<p>“I hope to try. It is the kind of work that
I like. But do you not think—” with much
hesitation in her tone, “that it is great good fortune
for me?”</p>

<p>“But you deserve it, every bit. I rejoice
that God did send it to you. Once in awhile
some event comes out just right in this world.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “I want to tell you a few of
our plans. I cannot help but think it best that
Mrs. Fairlie and Kate have gone abroad. I shall
feel more free, and he will have no opposition to
encounter. Though I was afraid at first that it
was not quite fair nor honest.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was best. And if they consult
their own fancies and leave him alone they cannot
blame him for marrying.”</p>

<p>“He wanted it to be very soon, though we
have been engaged barely a month. I put it
off until Autumn. There are so many things to
think about. And he is <em>so</em> good.”</p>

<p>“He is. There can be no doubt on that
point.”</p>

<p>“You know I could never leave mother. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
told him so when he first spoke. I must have
her with me, do for her while she lives, share
part of my interest with her, and take much of
hers. A person who cannot go out is so very
dependant. He said that her home should be
always with us, there was plenty of room in
the house, and he meant to be a son to her;
that he had never had a real mother like her.
I am to make over all right in this place to
her, and she can sell it or rent it, and have a
little income of her own.”</p>

<p>“It is delightful. I shall be thankful to have
you in <em>that</em> house. You will make a home of
it, which it never has been.”</p>

<p>“We are going on in a quiet old fashioned
way. I suppose people will <em>think</em>,” and an arch
light crossed her face.</p>

<p>“They have not thought very much about it
yet.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell you first. And your mother
and Fanny.”</p>

<p>“Yes;” I replied softly.</p>

<p>That seemed taking the matter too tamely. I
ran to her and clasped my arms around her
neck, making an extravagant speech between
my kisses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>Then we branched into relative topics, side
issues that presented themselves in a chance
fashion. How wide her range of sight was!
Some way we touched upon position and station.</p>

<p>“That is part of the knowledge;” she said in
her bright, sweet way. “I have learned a
lesson that I mean to put in practice if God
does give me the opportunity. It is—holding
up, and not pushing down.”</p>

<p>I understood her inconsequent little speech.</p>

<p>“Rich people can do so many pleasant things.
Their position keeps them quite free. They
are not misunderstood, at least no one can accuse
them of unworthy motives. It seems to me that
they might sometimes hold out their hands to
the next best. It would not hurt them. I don’t
want ever to forget this.”</p>

<p>I knew she would not.</p>

<p>“It has been hard;” I said softly, thinking
of the past.</p>

<p>“Why was I not as good and refined and
lady-like? What difference was it whether I
worked for the mothers of children one way or
another, teaching them, or sewing for them? I
was not likely to crowd in without an invitation.
And how much better shall I be as mistress of
Mr. Fairlie’s house than I am now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>“It is one of the bitter and unjust ways of
the world.”</p>

<p>“I feel as if I should not like to be taken
into favor again solely for the money. I know
the setting usually displays the stone to a better
advantage, but why cannot people see it
before the gold begins to glitter? The only
drawback to perfect happiness is that Richard’s
mother and sister would <em>not</em> approve. Yet once
Kate Fairlie and I were very good friends.”</p>

<p>“Kate is not really a fair test. There are
others—”</p>

<p>“I know it. I ought to be ashamed to find
any fault. But I hope I never shall forget how
it feels to be crowded out of bright and pleasant
things.”</p>

<p>There was a little stir, and a soft voice called—“Jennie.”
Presently Mrs. Ryder made her
appearance, and then the real visiting began.
We chatted about the village people, the sick
and the well, the babies and the old folks,
mamma’s visit to New York which was not an
old story here. I could see they too, suspected
Stephen Duncan of a penchant for Fanny.</p>

<p>Jennie walked home with me part of the way
for exercise, and we came back to Richard in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
our talk. She <em>did</em> love him very much. The
money had not tempted her.</p>

<p>I had a thought that afternoon too. As soon
as I was alone with Fan I put it into execution.
First I told her of the engagement, and she
rejoiced as thoroughly as I.</p>

<p>“Fan,” I said, “there is one thing that it
would be just lovely to do, if you could manage
it. If Miss Churchill and you could call on
Jennie Ryder, and have it look every-day-like
and social.”</p>

<p>“What a bright idea, Rose! Miss Churchill
will like her ever so much. It is odd how
many nice things you find in people when you
come to know them well. We will bring the
West Side over here and make them admire us.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> was quite a lively time in the
parish for a fortnight. Papa had two
marriages in Church, one of which was
Annie Fellows and Mr. Hunter. Then Miss
Maynard was married at home in a very exclusive
and elegant manner. Fifty-five dollars for
all of it. Wedding fees were mamma’s money.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as we need spend it just
now;” she said, “I think I will lay it away
against time of necessity;” smilingly.</p>

<p>I imagined what that meant. Days and weeks
went on so fast.</p>

<p>Then papa’s sister came from Philadelphia to
make us a visit; Aunt Margaret for whom
Daisy had been named. She brought with her
a piece of pretty Nainsook muslin and some
laces for gifts. There were the three younger
children provided with new summer dresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>She was sweet and gracious, with that indescribable
lady-like charm, and then she insisted
upon helping everywhere. Altering dresses,
dusting rooms, talking to papa or tying up
vines and flowers in the garden—nothing came
amiss to her. She petitioned that Daisy should
be lent to her for the remainder of the summer.
She had one son at home, but her two daughters
were married and away.</p>

<p>Papa thought at first that it would not be
possible to spare her. Mamma said that she was
not prepared for so long a visit.</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Frances,” returned Aunt
Margaret, “I will attend to what is needful.
I don’t see how you get along with such a
host of little ones. If Edith had not come—”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Edith is the crown of all;” declared
Fan. “She brought rare good luck with
her. So many lovely things have happened to
us during the year. And now we couldn’t
spare her.”</p>

<p>Aunt Margaret smiled. “You have been
very fortunate in your children,” she said, glancing
at mamma.</p>

<p>Miss Churchill came over with the barouche
and took the elders riding. It was a lovely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
afternoon late in May, and the whole world was
abloom with beauty and sweetness.</p>

<p>She and Fanny had dropped in one day at
Mrs. Ryder’s and had a charming call. Afterward
Fan had whispered the secret.</p>

<p>“The young man is to be congratulated;”
declared Miss Churchill. “She will make a
pretty, cheerful wife, and that will be much to
a man like Mr. Fairlie. I am glad he has been
so sensible and I must see more of her before
she leaves her old station. My dear, I am afraid
I shall turn into a regular village gossip, I
am so fond of young girls and their affairs.”</p>

<p>It began to be guessed at elsewhere as well,
for the two went out driving now and then of
an afternoon.</p>

<p>Allie West and Dora Hyde were over one
evening and it happened to be touched upon.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is anything in it;”
exclaimed Dora. “Dick Fairlie will not throw
himself away in that style! Why, he could
have the best in the town with that handsome
place of his.”</p>

<p>“I am sure Jennie is quite pretty;” said Fan,
“and nicely educated. She reads French and
German, is well up in history and house-keeping,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
sings beautifully and sews in the same fashion.
What better can a man want?”</p>

<p>“O, you know what I mean! And she is
poor.”</p>

<p>“He has enough for both. And the Ryders
are a respectable old family.”</p>

<p>“I know she is a favorite of yours,” returned
Dora loftily, “but I never discovered anything
special about her. And I do not see how she
can leave her mother, I should think her duty
would be there.”</p>

<p>Fan laughed at that.</p>

<p>“I shall not believe it until I hear it from a
better source. Some people make so much out
of a trifle of ordinary politeness.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I would not,” Fan continued seriously.</p>

<p>“There, you see Fanny doesn’t believe it;”
said Allie West triumphantly.</p>

<p>“As if any one in her senses could!” Dora
added.</p>

<p>After they went away Fan sat glancing out
of the window thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I allowed them to think what was not quite
true,” she said slowly, “but I did not want the
fact to leak out. Some very smart young
woman might write to Kate and alarm her. It
had better go on quietly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>We missed Daisy ever so much. You would
hardly think it among so many.</p>

<p>Then came a letter from Mr. Duncan, stating
that he intended to follow it in time to keep
the festival of baby’s christening. There were
some business matters on which he wished to
consult papa, and he was longing for a sight of
the household, from least to greatest. Louis
was much better. Mrs. Whitcomb was well and
had utterly refused her first vacation. What
did Fanny expect to do in such a case of insubordination?
He was sorry he had proved so
attractive, but it was more his misfortune than
his fault, so she must not visit him too heavily
with her displeasure.</p>

<p>We all had a good laugh over it. I arranged
the guest-chamber in the morning, flowers and
all, and in the afternoon went cantering round
the parish, as Fan often expressed it. She had
been smitten with such a passion for sewing,
and the Churchills took up so much of her time
that I had to visit for both. I was beginning
to feel quite grave and staid with my eighteen
and a half years. The fact of Fan’s having a
real lover affected me in a rather curious fashion.
It seemed as if the romance was to begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
with her and go down. It shut me out as it
were; but never having counted myself in, I
did not feel much disappointed. I was to be
the house-daughter. Already I could see that
papa had begun to depend more upon me. He
brought his gloves to be mended, and used to
ask me now and then to find various little matters
for him. True, mamma was much occupied
with Edith. I liked the growing nearer though,
the tender confidence and trust.</p>

<p>I could see how it would be. One by one
the birdlings would fly out of the home nest.
I was an every-day useful body and would be
needed to help the others, make some ready to
go and comfort those who staid. I didn’t suppose
the sweet grace and patience that glorified
Miss Oldway’s face would ever come in mine.
It was such a round, funny little face, and would
get so sun-burned in summer. No one could
ever call me fair and dainty.</p>

<p>I laughed over it softly to myself, I was in
such a merry mood. In ten years I should be
twenty-eight, getting on the “list” a wee bit,
visiting round the same as usual, carrying broths
and jellies, listening to sorrows and complaints,
and by that time, perhaps, a little better, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
little nearer the Great ensample so that I could
say my say without faltering.</p>

<p>My basket was emptied at length. I leaned
over the fence awhile and talked with Mrs. Day,
who “could not see why,” about something.
Aunt Letty Perkins came along, puffing and
wheezing. She had been confined to the house
a good deal since Christmas, with the asthma,
and if it was not irreverent I should say—“Israel
had had peace.”</p>

<p>“All well, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>

<p>“I never see such folks. You don’t have a
bit of sickness or trouble like other people!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Day, as if she felt personally
aggrieved. “I never saw the match to that baby,
and my poor lamb in the church-yard!”</p>

<p>I wanted to reply that it was the care and
watchfulness, the love and tenderness that never
tired. We did not suffer real heart-felt trouble,
but there were hard pinches and perplexities,
many things given up that we longed to have,
hours of patient industry, self-denial and all that.
Do discontented people ever realize what steady
courage and grace it takes to make many lives
look fair and sweet?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s out of its trouble,” pursued Aunt
Letty. “You never can tell what children are
coming to. Goin’ to take boarders agen this
summer?”</p>

<p>That last to me. I started and colored at
the impertinence. I wanted to resent it, but I
knew that would not help for an example.</p>

<p>“Mr. Duncan is at home and can take care
of his brothers;” I replied quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, they want much addition to the
neighborhood. That young one was a master-hand
at mischief. I should have wanted a good
deal of money to pay me.”</p>

<p>“Good-night;” I said rather abruptly, “I
must be going.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come in? I haven’t seen
your ma in an age. Nobody drops in when
I am sick, though if I do say it myself, I’ve
always been neighborly. No one can say I ever
went on the other side like the publican.”</p>

<p>“Indeed they could not,” I thought to myself
with a smile.</p>

<p>All this made me later than I expected to be.
As I came up the road I saw Fanny and Mr.
Duncan walking slowly to meet me.</p>

<p>Something dreadful flashed into my mind at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
that moment and made my face scarlet. I remembered
that in my talk with Louis I had
spoken of the probability of Stephen’s marrying
Fanny. What if he had repeated that bit of
idle gossip? Stuart would have done so from
pure love of teasing.</p>

<p>“Why, Rose, how you have hurried! You are
as red as your reddest namesake. Do stop and
cool off a moment, child!”</p>

<p>That from Fanny did not make me any paler.
I felt the contrast very keenly. She tall and
elegant, with her graceful self-possession, and I
such a little budget! I don’t know why I
should have cared just at that moment, but I
felt mortified enough to cry.</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan put out his hand. I just touched
the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you.” Then he looked
me all over with those strange eyes of his that
could be so dark and piercing.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it late?” I asked. “I am sure supper
must be ready. Please excuse me,” and I
hurried on.</p>

<p>They turned as well. I rushed up-stairs, bathed
my face and gave my hair a brush. Then I
went to the glass a moment to pull it out. No,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
I was not a beauty. If Mr. Duncan had <em>not</em>
come to-day! He could spend Sunday without
starting as early as Friday afternoon!</p>

<p>When I went down they were all gathered
around the table. He glanced up sharply again,
and I was foolish enough to blush.</p>

<p>Not an unnecessary word did I utter. I had
a constricted feeling about my throat and tongue
and could not tell what was the matter with me,
I believe I felt cross. I was glad to go to the
study afterward and give papa the messages that
had been sent for him.</p>

<p>Nelly called me to see about a skirt she was letting
down. Tim and Lily put themselves to
bed now, and I had only to go in and pick up
their clothes. Fanny and Mr. Duncan were
singing in the parlor, but I did not go down
until I heard mamma’s voice. They were talking
about Mrs. Whitcomb.</p>

<p>He had found her so admirable. Lady-like
and refined, yet not weak; clear-eyed and resolute,
yet without any hardness.</p>

<p>“She is always in bloom, I believe. The
winter, and the desert, and the bare, bristling
hill-tops may be a short distance off, but just
around her it is spring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“There everlasting spring abides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And never withering flowers;”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Fan murmured softly.</p>

<p>“That is just it. She has had some troubles,
also.”</p>

<p>“Indeed she has,” returned mamma, “Losses,
deaths and trials. But now she has gone out of
her own life. Her perceptions are so quick,
tender and unerring. She seems to discern from
afar off the needs and wants of human souls
and ministers gently to your own thought, not
hers.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Mrs. Endicott?”</p>

<p>Mamma answered with a smile and said it all.
She often talked with the expressions of her face
in that sweet instantaneous manner, explaining
a subject better than many words would have
done.</p>

<p>“I begin to believe that religion <em>has</em> something
in it. There is a point beyond natural amiability.”</p>

<p>“Have you been doubting?”</p>

<p>He blushed and laughed in an embarrassed,
school-boy fashion.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have exactly doubted,
but I have not believed in any vital way. Still
I considered myself a Christian gentleman until
very recently.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>“And what then?”</p>

<p>“I found myself a proud and honorable gentleman
instead, who abhorred meanness, falsehood,
dishonesty and the whole catalogue of
those sins because they were blots and stains,
hideous in my sight. I had no patience with
them in that they never tempted me. I liked
my life to be pure and just, but it was for myself
alone. I did not think of what God might
require; the higher aim. After all, it is <em>His</em>
relation with every human soul, His holding out
the faith and love and atonement to us, made
for us so long ago in His great wisdom, and
which is for us whether we take it or not. But
we want to try <em>our</em> wisdom first.”</p>

<p>“That leads to the trouble and the clashing.
We so often set up our own will and when we
are buffeted about take it as a sort of direct
martyrdom, when it is only a natural result of
an ordinary cause. We sometimes cry out—‘Why
has God sent this upon me?’ when we
bring the trials upon ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Then we have to go back. We find
the plans and specifications and the materials all
right, left on the highway, while we used stones
and timber of our own, changed the plan according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
to our liking. We have to take out a good
deal of work in this life.”</p>

<p>“And we learn by degrees to be careful, to
come to Him, to ask first of all—‘Lord, what
wilt thou have me to do?’”</p>

<p>“And learning to follow it, is the great lesson.”</p>

<p>He turned his head a trifle and lapsed into
deep thought. Fan glanced over at me in a
peculiar manner as if she triumphed in what he
said, and it was only proving a well established
point. She puzzled me. Why, when she liked
him so well herself, was there not the deeper
and farther-reaching sympathy of love? He was
really nobler than Winthrop Ogden.</p>

<p>We did not have any confidence until late
Saturday afternoon. Fan was writing a letter
in her room and mamma had gone to visit some
sick people. I had Edith fenced off in a corner
of the porch and was amusing her while I sewed
a little.</p>

<p>He came and studied me curiously. That was
what I did not like. If I had been as pretty
as Fan, or if my hair were any other color!</p>

<p>“You have not asked me a word about your
friend. Have you lost interest in him now that
he is delivered over to my keeping?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>I understood whom he meant.</p>

<p>“Why, we have all talked—I have heard—”
and I paused in surprise, for a tiny frown
came in his brow.</p>

<p>“But the work was so much yours.”</p>

<p>“You exaggerate it, Mr. Duncan.”</p>

<p>I might have spoken coldly. Somehow I could
not let myself be praised in his words, and with
his eyes upon me.</p>

<p>“Are you so used to good deeds that you
consider this nothing?”</p>

<p>I flushed and felt a lump rising in my throat.</p>

<p>“I would have done it for any one.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Miss Endicott. Louis is not
so admirable that he should be singled out.”</p>

<p>“He is—you don’t do him justice;” I said
almost ready to cry.</p>

<p>“I did <em>not</em> I will admit, but I am trying to
now. Will you not accept my penitence and
my sincere desire to be tender as well as just?”</p>

<p>“I know you mean to do the very best. I
think you will.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I am afraid you consider us all
rather heathenish. I have only recently come
to understand the full duty that I owe my
brothers. I had left them in my uncle’s hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
quite satisfied, and believing that boys came up,
somehow. <em>I</em> had no great trouble.”</p>

<p>“Because you were stronger. And Louis’
health and temperament are so different.”</p>

<p>“I have learned that I could not make him
come to me, so I have gone to him.”</p>

<p>“He did come—”</p>

<p>“Yes; that was not the point I referred to,
however. It is in the matter of confidence. He
is so very reserved, so sensitive, so <em>touchy</em>, to
use a common phrase. At a word he draws
into his shell and keeps silence.”</p>

<p>“I found that out last summer,” I said with
a smile.</p>

<p>“How did you manage?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I answered looking over at
the distant hills. “It just came, I think. When
he wouldn’t talk on any subject I let it drop.”</p>

<p>“Ah, wise little one, there may be a secret,
in that. I fancy that I have a failing in my
desire to convince people. I want them to see
the right.”</p>

<p>“It is easier seen than confessed, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“True. And Louis has a giant of pride. If
he is hurt he will not stop to explain. If you
misunderstand, he will not set you right. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
have to grope your way along in perplexity.
Yet I think we are coming a little nearer to
each other, through you.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Whitcomb. She has a way of
uniting people, of healing differences.”</p>

<p>“I am doubly fortunate in having her. Otherwise
I must have borrowed—your mother.”</p>

<p>I smiled a little at this. It made me think
of the Churchills borrowing Fan. Isn’t it so the
world over? The sweetness and brightness of
other lives comes into ours, sometimes the darkness
and sorrow. We rarely stand alone.</p>

<p>“I believe I like frank, open natures the best;”
he went on. “And cheerfulness. A great outgiving
like the world and the sunshine.”</p>

<p>“But when one has been in a cave a long
while the light dazzles. Some people do not
want to take in but a little at a time, and perhaps
we hurt them by thrusting so much into their
very souls.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “When a man is starving
you do not feast him at once. I must
remember that.”</p>

<p>Edith began to worry. I took her up in my
arms and hushed her softly.</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan was not looking at me, but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
strange, tender light came into his face, a half
smile that brought the dawn to my mind by
way of comparison. He seemed to pay no attention
to me for many minutes, but just to be
occupied with his own reflections. I rose to
take Edith in, as she evinced unmistakable symptoms
of hunger.</p>

<p>He put his arm over her and partly over my
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I cannot let you go without an acknowledgement,”
he began hurriedly. “I should like
to tell you <em>just</em> how Louis came back. There
was a manliness in his penitence that has given
me a great deal of hope. Yet I know that he
did not come out of actual love for me. If we
ever <em>could</em> reach that state, but I must wait
patiently. I have thought so little of him all
these years, except to look after his personal
comfort, that I must not complain if I reap
weeds instead of flowers. You were brave and
strong in your advice to him, and God above
knows how deeply and sincerely I thank you.
Your note to me was wisdom itself. Only—”</p>

<p>There was a peculiar wistfulness in his face
that somehow gave him a little look of Louis.</p>

<p>“Only what?” If there was any fault to find
let us have it out now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>“If you <em>could</em> have trusted me unreservedly.
Do you think I am so very stern and rigid and
unforgiving?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid you might—I did not know—”
and I stopped, distressed and blushing.</p>

<p>“Will you have a little more faith in me?”</p>

<p>He uttered the words slowly.</p>

<p>“I know you desire to do what is best.”</p>

<p>He looked a trifle disappointed, I thought,
but I went in with Edith and left him standing
there.</p>

<p>After all I had not done anything very wonderful
that there should be such a fuss and
thanks and all that bother. It annoyed me. I
could not carry triumphs gracefully as Fan did,
sit in the centre and have an admiring audience
around me.</p>

<p>One part of the visit proved an unalloyed
delight, and that was papa’s enjoyment of it.
He and Mr. Duncan fitted, if you can understand
the term. It was almost like father and
son. Plans were talked over, the boys’ future
discussed, and in Stephen’s newer experience
there was a great charm. Like the young man
who came to Christ, he had kept the commandments
from his youth up, he had been truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
and integrity itself, but the one greater thing had
come to him now. It crowned his manliness.
He did not speak of it in a shame-faced way, as
if it was something to be kept on one side of his
life and rather in the background, but he set it
in the very midst. A rare, almost boyish humility
was discernable in his conversations with
papa. I liked so much better to listen than to
have him talk to me.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I shall grow proud in my old
days,” said papa a few evenings afterward. “Such
first fruits as Mr. Duncan and Miss Churchill
seem a whole harvest. I shall never be discouraged
again.”</p>

<p>Indeed, Miss Churchill had become the Lady
Bountiful of the parish. I do not mean simply
among the poor. The rich need the gospel of
charity and loving kindness as well. They were
meeting together, being incited to good works,
losing the narrow feelings and prejudices.</p>

<p>Fan and I had a lovely episode this summer.
Just at the beginning of the hot weather Miss
Lucy had a spell of feeling very weak and miserable.</p>

<p>“She must have a change,” declared good old
Doctor Hawley. “She has been among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
mountains so long that she has worn them out.
Take her away to the sea-side.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go,” said Miss Lucy in faint protest.
“I do not like strange faces nor places, and the
worry and bustle will consume what little strength
I have.”</p>

<p>“You will wear out this old strength and get
some new. You are tired to death of this,
though you are so set in your way that you
will not confess it. I know what is best for
you! Miss Esther, if you want to keep Christmas
with her, take her away now.”</p>

<p>Then he thumped his cane resolutely on the
floor, a way he had when he was very much in
earnest.</p>

<p>When it came to that something must be
done.</p>

<p>They talked it over—Miss Churchill and her
brother, then Miss Churchill and mamma. And
this came out of it all, as if we were to be in
the midst of everything.</p>

<p>They would go to Martha’s Vineyard. In
earlier years they had spent whole summers
there. And she and Miss Lucy wanted us.
We had seen so little outside of our own home,
that the change would do us good. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
the great sea, the islands all about, and a new
world, so to speak.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to get both of them ready,”
mamma exclaimed in a hopeless puzzle.</p>

<p>“You are thinking of the dresses—but we
are not going to be fashionable. Some nice
light worsted goods for traveling, and beyond
that there is nothing as pretty as white. We
shall have a cottage to ourselves and our meals
sent in. Then I intend to take Martha, who is
an excellent laundress, so the dresses will be no
trouble. Kenton is counting on the pleasure, and
you must not refuse.”</p>

<p>“It is a great—favor,” said mamma timidly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to think of it in that light.
Kenton and I are getting along in years, and
Lucy will not last forever. We might as well
take and give a little pleasure. It is just as if
a sister asked you.”</p>

<p>And it actually came about. We had new
gray dresses trimmed with bands of pongee;
Fan’s a shade lighter and mine two or three
shades darker than the material. When they
were all finished they had cost but twenty-three
dollars. Our spring straw hats were retrimmed,
our gloves and ribbons and boots looked over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>“One trunk will hold our modest wardrobe,”
declared Fan. “I often think of the Vicar of
Wakefield and the many devices the girls resorted
to. It is rather funny to be poor, after all! You
are not so much worried and fidgeted and dissatisfied.
You take the best you can get, and
you <em>know</em> you cannot do any better. So you enjoy
the tour or the journey or whatever it is, because
you are altogether outside of your troublesome
self.”</p>

<p>“But you will be—very well off—some day,”
I said with bashful hesitation.</p>

<p>“I don’t think of that, any more. Until the
very day of my marriage my life is <em>here</em>. What
papa can give me will always be infinitely precious
to me. We will have all the happiness
out of our poverty that we can.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p>“And I know just how Miss Churchill is giving
us this. So far as the money goes she will
never feel it. We will afford her pleasure,
satisfaction and delight in return, which will
make it quite an even thing.”</p>

<p>We remained three weeks and it was enchanting.
The great ocean with its ceaseless surges
and swells, its floods of molten gold at sunset,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
the showers and one tremendous storm, the walks
and rides on the sands, the short sails hither
and thither, the quaint cottages, the strange
people from almost everywhere, some of whom
we soon became acquainted with, the newness
and the variety was splendid! We enjoyed
every moment. Sometimes I felt quite wild indeed,
as if I could race along the sea sands and
shout with the wildest of the birds.</p>

<p>The last week was the crowning point. Winthrop
came and Miss Churchill took us to Newport
for one night and two days. There was elegance
and fashion at the hotel to be sure, but Fan in
her pretty white over-dress and the bloom of her
fresh, sweet youth, attracted many a glance of
admiration on the one side, and almost envy
from some of the worn and faded women. It
was a bit of Arabian Nights’ Entertainment
brought into our own lives.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy did improve ever so much. She
could not bathe to be sure, but the pungent air
revived and strengthened her. We were all so
bright and happy, so full of fun and whims and
oddities. There is a fascinating queerness about
almost every person when the true self comes out
and you forget that any one is watching you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>It was so delightful that we came home with
almost a sigh, until we reached the familiar
places. It was the first time that we had ever
been so long away from mamma, and when we
thought of that our hearts were full to overflowing.</p>

<p>There was Mrs. Whitcomb in the midst helping
to keep house, filling up our vacant places.</p>

<p>“You need not think you are the only ones
who can have a holiday!” she exclaimed laughingly.</p>

<p>Oh, the blessedness of being right among the
accustomed faces, to be kissed and kissed again,
to be pulled about hither and yon, to be shown
this and that, “which was not so when you
went away;” the atmosphere of home-living and
thinking, which is so different from railroad cars
and hotels, or even other people’s cottages.</p>

<p>“But the sea still sings in my ears,” I said
to Fan as I laid my head on my pillow.</p>

<p>“And to-morrow morning it will be robins
or swallows ‘twittering’ under the eaves. What
a great, grand thing it is to live and be happy!
Rose, if people could realize the satisfying joy
they put in the lives of others when they share
their pleasures I think the whole world would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
go at it. It would be giving and receiving all
round the wide earth.”</p>

<p>Are we thankful enough for happiness, I wonder?
For that is something a little apart from
life, one of the things not surely promised, like
the peace of God. Should there not be a special
thanksgiving for every blessed day, for the breath
of fragrance, the pleasantness of sunshine, and
the subtle essence of delight that wafts itself
across our sky—tender human love?</p>

West, and would be gone a month or
more. They had grown so much, Mrs.
Whitcomb said, and were almost men.</p>

<p>“Which do <em>you</em> like best?” asked Fan.</p>

<p>“I think Louis will make the nobler character.
Stuart would rather take life just as it

quite so much pains with the finishing. Not
but what I consider finishing a great deal.
Clean paths beautify a garden so much, but I
have seen people just hoe off the tops and sprinkle
gravel or sand over them. The weeds spring
up after a rain.”</p>

<p>“Has not Louis the outside and inside faults
as well?” asked Fan.</p>

<p>“Yes. Only his weeds are seldom covered
up. Some folks never can cover up anything.
He cannot be good outside until he has killed
the weeds inside. Stuart may be fair all his
life without any fighting.”</p>

<p>“He <em>is</em> good-tempered;” I subjoined.</p>

<p>“He has a pleasant, sunny temper, perfect
health, and no nerves to speak of. It is no
effort for him to be jolly. He is gentlemanly
by instinct, he likes to be in the centre, shooting
rays in every direction. Is it wonderful if
somebody comes within their radius? The somebody
may think this particular brightness is
meant for him, but in an instant Stuart may
wheel round and leave this very person in the
dark.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you have some hope of Louis;”
I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span></p>

<p>She seemed to study Fan, the great column
of wisteria and me, all at the same moment.</p>

<p>“There are some special providences in this
world, I do believe,” she began. “Mr. Duncan’s
coming here was one, and your taking the
boys another.”</p>

<p>“Which we should not have done if we had
<em>not</em> been very poor,” said Fan with an odd
pucker in her face.</p>

<p>“Well, we will give poverty the credit. Mr.
Duncan’s visit here taught him some new ideas
of duty. Not but what he would have been a just,
even a kind brother in any event. But relationship
counts for so little now-a-days. Very
few people expect to be their brothers’ keepers.
They are willing to do grand things for others,
for the heathen, for some great accident that
stirs up the sympathy of the whole world, but
the common every day duties are tiresome.”</p>

<p>“They are,” said Fan. “It may be heterodox,
but it is true all the same.”</p>

<p>“That is just it,” and Mrs. Whitcomb gave
her sweet, tender smile that was worth a week
of June sunshine. “God knew how tiresome
they would be, or he would not have given
such continual lessons of patience and love, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
working and waiting. Think of the mustard
seed and the corn, and the candle; the piece of
money and the one lost sheep. It is nearly all
little things. And when He saith—‘If a man
love not his brother whom he hath seen, how
can he love God whom he hath <em>not</em> seen.’ It
is the home love that is going to save the world.
Stephen saw it here, and it roused his dormant
affection.”</p>

<p>“You see it would not do for us to quarrel,”
said Fan drolly. “We are packed in like peas
in a pod, or birds in a nest, or bricks in a sidewalk.
There isn’t any room.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you have learned that. I think
too, it is the lesson you are all to teach the
world.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Fan with a blush of real
humility.</p>

<p>“We must be poor and barren indeed, if we
do not teach something. And the influence last
summer did a great deal for Louis. It was the beginning
of his salvation. It was the beginning of
Stephen’s higher life, also. Before that he would
have saved his brothers for pride’s sake, now he
will endeavor to do it for God’s sake, because
he has been redeemed in the love, as well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p>“It is sermons in everything,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Whitcomb,” I began presently, “do
you know anything about—Louis when he came
home?” Somehow I could never have asked
Stephen, much as I wanted to know.</p>

<p>“It was late in the afternoon, just growing
dusky. I did not know him when he asked
for Mr. Duncan, but before I had crossed the
hall I guessed, so I took him to the library,
and summoned Stephen from his room up stairs.
They talked for a long while and then Stephen
asked that tea might be brought to them. Louis
lay on the sofa while I spread the little table.
I could hear the sound of tears in Stephen’s
voice at every word he spoke. At nine, perhaps,
he took Louis up to the chamber that had been
prepared for him. When he came down I was
busy putting the library in order. I just asked—‘Is
it all right?’ and he answered—‘It is the
beginning of right.’ And then he added—shall
I tell you Rose?—‘I think Louis and I will
owe something of what is best in our lives to
Rose Endicott!’”</p>

<p>“I wish they wouldn’t;” I cried in distress.
“But it <em>is</em> all made up between them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in a better manner than if the trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
had not happened. Out of it all they have
learned to love each other. Louis has a great,
shy, morbid, hungry heart, and a most unfortunate
temper.”</p>

<p>“And we are as poor as church mice, and
angelic;” said Fan in her gayest mood. “After
all, the gifts and graces are pretty fairly distributed.”</p>

<p>We went into supper and had other topics of
conversation. One of the most important was
sending papa away for a little vacation. When
Mr. Churchill heard of that he held up both
hands, and they were not empty. Papa must
stay over one Sunday and he would see about a
clergyman. It was very odd to be without a
head to our household that length of time. He
went to Long Island, to Cape May and Philadelphia,
bringing Daisy home with him.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Fan and I were in the
midst of a small excitement. Jennie Ryder was
to be married and wanted us both for bridesmaids,
“that is,” she said—“I want you, and
Richard wants Fan. And I don’t wish you to
make a bit of fuss. I am going to be married
in church at eight in the morning, in white
organdie, because Richard loves white so much.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
Otherwise I should take my traveling dress.
We do not intend to send out any invitations,
and you must be simple, so as not to outshine
me.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you have instructed us. We
<em>might</em> have rushed into some extravagance. May
we have our white gowns done up fresh, please?”
asked Fan comically.</p>

<p>Jennie laughed. She was very happy, one
could see that. A connection had come to stay
with Mrs. Ryder while Jennie was away, for
Richard had insisted upon Niagara and the
Canadas. Afterward they were to move into
the great house.</p>

<p>Papa came home on Saturday night, looking
brown and bright and rested. On Tuesday morning
Jennie was married. Winthrop came to
stand with Fan, I think he would not have
trusted any one else. He was troubled with an
insane belief that every body wanted Fan,
“which is <em>werry</em> flattering on his part,” said Fan,
“considering that the only other lover I ever
had has gone off and married some one else,
never breaking his heart a bit!”</p>

<p>“Would you have had him, Fanny?”</p>

<p>“No, little goosie! And he has the best wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
that he could have found in the wide world.”</p>

<p>The fact had been noised abroad, and the
marriage was quite largely attended. It provoked
various comments. I think there were
some who did envy Jennie Ryder her good
fortune, and many who rejoiced in it. Still
there was a feeling that Richard’s mother would
not quite approve. He had written to her and
Kate, not giving them time to answer by the
marriage date.</p>

<p>I felt my own heart beat as I stood there so
still and solemn. There was a great awe in
going out of the old life and putting on the
new, belonging to yourself one moment, and the
next having the sense of ownership irrevocably
taken away. I shivered a little wondering how
any one could be glad to do it. Some day Fan
would stand there, and I would feel her gone
out of my life.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Whitcomb had to return to get
the house in order. Louis expected to enter
Columbia College. Stephen thought it better on
account of his health, and the home influence.
Stuart would be away another year.</p>

<p>Enclosed in her letter was a note to mamma.
Would it be agreeable for Louis to spend a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
week or ten days with us? He was very
anxious so to do.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered mamma.</p>

<p>Indeed we were pleased with the opportunity
of seeing him. Somehow he had become quite
a hero in our eyes.</p>

<p>I really do not think I should have known
him elsewhere. I was up in my room sitting
on the low window-sill in the breeze, reading a
magazine. The blinds were tied a little apart,
bowed, and as I heard the gate click I looked
down. He was nearly as tall as Stephen, and
though slender had filled out to a certain manly
roundness. He nodded to some one, threw back
his head and laughed, and he was positively
handsome. His complexion was dark but no
longer sallow, it had the bronze tint of exposure
and a healthful red in the cheeks. His
black hair was cropped pretty close, but it
showed his broad forehead, and there was a
tiny line of dark moustache that contrasted with
the fresh scarlet of his lips.</p>

<p>I ran down. Mamma and Edith were on the
porch. I do really believe that mamma had
been kissing him, at all events his face was
flushed and his eyes had a soft, dewy look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>

<p>“You are the same, you haven’t altered a
bit! It was so good of you to let me come.”</p>

<p>“Why, we wanted to see you,” replied mamma.</p>

<p>He was still holding my hands, and I could
not help blushing under his steady gaze.</p>

<p>“But you have grown and changed out of all
reason.”</p>

<p>“Minnesota did that! For the first time in
my life I am not absolutely scrawny! We had
such a splendid tour! Stephen was just royal,
as much of a boy as either of us. We have
climbed mountains, camped out, hunted and
fished and everything! I did not want to come
back.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you so much improved,”
and mamma glanced him over with a sort of
motherly pride.</p>

<p>He sat down on the step at her feet, and began
to play with Edith who affected baby shyness.
We did not have him long to ourselves
though, for Nelly came and in a moment or two
the children. They were all surprised.</p>

<p>I watched him as he talked. He was so much
more fluent and self-possessed. It was not Stuart’s
brightness, but more like Stephen’s reliance, and
a peculiar command of self, an earnestness that
sat well upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>

<p>“You cannot think how I wanted to see this
place once more. How good you were to me
when I lay sick up-stairs. Miss Rose, do you
remember getting me some honeysuckle blooms
one afternoon? I shall always associate them
with you. I shall be glad to the latest day of my
life that Stephen sent me here, though I made
a desperate fight to go to Lake George with
some school-fellows.”</p>

<p>“It was fortunate that you did not, for you
would have been ill in any event,” answered
mamma quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes. How is—everybody? And that Mr.
Fairlie is married? Does Miss Churchill come
as she used?”</p>

<p>She was still among our best friends, we told
him. Fanny was there spending the day.</p>

<p>Presently papa returned and he was full of
joy at the improvement. Why, it was almost
like having a boy of one’s very own! I would
not have believed that he could be so agreeable
if I had not seen it, or else I wondered if we
had not made a mistake last summer.</p>

<p>There was supper and music after that, and
Fan’s return, and the next day papa invited him
to go over the river with him, as he had a horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
and wagon. Consequently I saw nothing of him
until evening. Mamma asked me to take some
grapes to a sick parishioner.</p>

<p>“Allow me to accompany you;” he said, getting
his hat.</p>

<p>It was very foolish but I could not help the
color coming into my face as we walked down
the path. He had such a grown-up, gentlemanly
air; he opened the gate and closed it
again, and took the outside of the walk and
glanced at me in a kind of protecting fashion.</p>

<p>“Do you know that you are very little?” he
began presently.</p>

<p>“Fully five feet.”</p>

<p>“But then I am getting to be such a great
fellow!”</p>

<p>I looked at him and laughed.</p>

<p>“What now?” and he colored suddenly.</p>

<p>“I was thinking—of something so absurd!
Fan used to accuse me of preaching—”</p>

<p>“And very good sermons they were. I may
want you to preach again.”</p>

<p>“I should be afraid,” glancing up at him.</p>

<p>He laughed then. After a moment or two
another expression crossed his face, and it grew
more and more serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p>“I believe the sermons saved me. There was
a time when I should have hated to own such
a thing—and from a woman, too; so you may
know how I have conquered myself.”</p>

<p>“The best of all victories.”</p>

<p>“Looking back at myself I wonder how you
tolerated me last summer. I was ill and nervous
to the last degree, but I had a frightful
temper. I was proud and sullen, and—ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“Not always that.”</p>

<p>“I think I hated almost everybody. I did
not want to be governed or counseled. And
Stephen was so—rigid and prompt. He treated
me like a little boy—”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“Some of it is true. He admits it. And
when that awful affair happened I expected he
would disown me. He is so proud, then he
never did anything bad in all his life. So I felt
that I had no mercy to expect from him.”</p>

<p>“But you were mistaken,” I said eagerly.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have gone there and in that way
but for you. Perhaps he has told you—” and
his eyes questioned mine.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, glad that we had not discussed
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span></p>

<p>“I went to him. I believe it was the first
manly step of my life. But, oh, I felt so forlorn
and miserable—I can’t tell you! If he
had been cold and cross I believe I should have
gone and thrown myself in the river.”</p>

<p>“He was not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rose, it was like the story of the prodigal
son. ‘Fell upon his neck and kissed him.’
I remember his kissing me the day father was
buried, and I do not believe any one ever did
since till then. It melted all my soul. Somehow
I think he is wonderfully changed. His
goodness is so tender.”</p>

<p>“And you love him?”</p>

<p>“Love isn’t any word. I absolutely adore
him! I did not think it was in me, or in him.
And all through the weeks that followed, for I
was very ill and miserable, he was so good. I
never talked to any one before, except you,
somehow I could not. But he found his way
to my heart and said he would help me, that
we would both try together, for he had many
faults to correct, that God had given us the tie
of brotherhood for a high and holy purpose, that
we were to help and strengthen each other; as
if, Rose—as if I <em>could</em> do anything for him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you can,” I replied. “You can keep
him tender and cordial and brotherly.”</p>

<p>“So he said. We did not come to this all at
once, and Mrs. Whitcomb’s cheerfulness helped.
I had to try hard to be patient. I was so used
to flying out at everything. You see, at uncle’s
they all knew that I had a bad temper, they
expected me to explode or sulk on the slightest
provocation, and only laughed or tormented me.
If I had been taught to control myself, it would
never have been so dreadful.”</p>

<p>“It is good to have the lesson learned now.”</p>

<p>“I never can forget it, never! I am not an
angel yet, Rose, cherubim or seraphim, I suppose
Miss Fanny would say;” and he smiled
oddly, “but I <em>am</em> trying. I do not disdain the
helps as I used to. I do not feel that patience
and self-control are exclusively girlish virtues.”</p>

<p>“No,” I returned, “we girls will not rob you
of them.”</p>

<p>“You are generous. But then you always
were. I am beginning to learn that the grand
corner-stones for the human soul are truth and
love, the truth that leads us to be fair and just
to others, and the love to our neighbor.”</p>

<p>“Here we are,” I said. “Do you want to
come in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>He followed me and we did our errand.</p>

<p>“I could not understand last summer why
you loved to do these things;” he began when
we were homeward-bound.</p>

<p>“You considered it an evidence of a depraved
taste?”</p>

<p>He smiled rather sadly.</p>

<p>“I supposed people consulted their <em>own</em> pleasure
first. Doing any rather distasteful deed and
hunting around until you found a bright side to
it was like so much Sanscrit to me.”</p>

<p>“He came not to please—Himself;” I said
solemnly.</p>

<p>“I understand a little now. Yet when He
had redeemed the world there must have been
a great joy in His own mind, as well as in
heaven.”</p>

<p>“We cannot do anything like that,” I said.
“But as He loved us, so we are to love the
brethren, the whole world.”</p>

<p>“To be willing to do for them. To seek not
our own pleasure altogether. It is very hard,
Rose, and sometimes I get discouraged. Then
Stephen tells me of his failures. It doesn’t go
on continually. It is a little doing all the time,
work and healing, and he says it will have to
be so in this world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered. “We cannot hinder nor
change. God sets the work before us, and
though the pleasant fields are all about us, we
have no right to choose our own paths. He
knows best in what ways He wants us to walk.”</p>

<p>“I talked to your father yesterday. I did not
think I could talk to anybody but you and Stephen.
I was sorry for all the pain and anxiety I had
caused him—and—it was almost like having a
father of one’s own. I don’t wonder that you
all have such sweet pleasant natures.”</p>

<p>We met Lily and Tim taking a walk, their
hands full of grasses and wild flowers, so we
turned them about and all went home together.</p>

<p>The visit proved a very delightful one. We
went to the Cascade one day, taking a lunch
with us, and on another day the Churchills sent
their family carriage over and we had a royal
time, crowding it full, and taking turns in driving.</p>

<p>We all noticed the great change in Louis.
Not that he was perfect or saintly. In fact I
think he was more of a boy, when it came to
that, than the summer before. He still had a
dangerous tendency to quickness of temper,
sometimes he would flush deeply when annoyed,
but he always spoke afterward in a low, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
tone of voice, as if he had gained the mastery
within. His feelings were more healthy-toned,
he had a heartsomeness that was genuine. You
never mistrusted it as you did Stuart’s.</p>

<p>We ended the festivities with a croquet and
tea-party on Saturday afternoon, asking in a half
dozen young people who all enjoyed themselves
amazingly. To the surprise of everybody, right
in the midst of the gayety who should drop
down upon us but Stephen Duncan.</p>

<p>“I was homesick to see you all,” he began,
with a comically lugubrious face.</p>

<p>“If you think you are going to be purely
ornamental you are much mistaken;” declared
Fanny. “Here is a mallet and here is a place.”</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me—”</p>

<p>“But I will not. No running away to the
study to talk with papa, or to play with Edith.
If you will come uninvited to a party you must
take the consequences.”</p>

<p>“Can I not soften your heart, if like the old
man I should ‘sit on the stile and continue to
smile?’”</p>

<p>“Not any smiles. I am obdurate.”</p>

<p>He pretended to be much aggrieved, but in
reality he was very gay. I had never seen him
so amusing and entertaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t see how you get acquainted with
such loads of nice people;” said Allie West.
“And you always have such good times here.”</p>

<p>The good times came without any trying.
There are numberless gates called Beautiful all
along life, at which you give such as you have,
and find it more precious than silver or gold.</p>

<p>It was a lovely moonlight night, so after supper
we walked part of the way with the merry
crowd. It did not seem to me that I had ever
been so happy in my life. I could not tell why but
I felt as if I must have wings somewhere that
were lifting me off the ground at every step.</p>

<p>We rambled around under the trees and by
the way side. Louis came back to my vicinity
and we fell into a rather grave talk about the
future.</p>

<p>“I never thought I should <em>want</em> to stay here
so much,” he said. “I was glad enough to get
away last summer. I cannot forgive myself for
being such a boor! Now I shall want to come
again and again.”</p>

<p>“Well why not?” I returned.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will become tired of me.”</p>

<p>“Try us and see. We are not easily wearied.”</p>

<p>“You are all so generous with yourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span></p>

<p>I smiled a little. “Why not give of your
best?”</p>

<p>“True.” Then there was a silence. We
reached the gate presently. “Do not go in just
yet;” he pleaded, so we remained in the silvery
light that was flooding the whole earth. Moonlight
always stirs the tender and thoughtful side
of one’s soul.</p>

<p>“I am glad that to-morrow will be Sunday. I
can just think how I shall enjoy going to church
and hearing your father preach.”</p>

<p>This from him who had despised religion and
sneered at sermons. It did startle me.</p>

<p>“And to have Stephen here.”</p>

<p>“I am rejoiced that you feel so kindly toward
one another,” I replied. “You are getting to be
brothers indeed.”</p>

<p>“And then will come weeks and weeks of
study,” he went on in a musing tone. “I like
it. Books seem to me—well, better than some
people. Only—if you could all come down in
the winter. Stephen and Mrs. Whitcomb were
planning for it, but there! it was a secret and
I have betrayed it.”</p>

<p>“I can keep secrets;” and I smiled up into
his remorseful face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; I have proved that. Rose”—after a
pause—“I have half a mind to tell you another,
to ask some—advice; at least, I would like to
know how it appears to you.”</p>

<p>“Will it be of any real avail?” I asked,
noting the perplexed lines on his countenance.
“I am not as wise as you think. Because I
just happened to stumble into one matter without
making a mess of it—”</p>

<p>“This is only an idea. I cannot ask Stephen.
I think it would please him and he might judge
wrongfully.”</p>

<p>“If I <em>can</em> help you;” I replied encouragingly.</p>

<p>“It is about the future. It may never come
to anything to be sure, and perhaps I never <em>can</em>
be good enough. Stuart will go into business.
He does not love study and he needs an active
life. He wanted Stephen to put him in a store
this Autumn. But I—”</p>

<p>I knew then what he meant. Somehow I
could not help laying my hand on his arm with
a touch of confidence.</p>

<p>“Whether I ever <em>could</em> so govern my temper
and my impatient desires;” bowing his head
humbly. “But if I had some guard about me,
if I felt that I <em>must</em> try continually—would it
be wrong to think of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span></p>

<p>“Surely not;” I returned warmly. “Nor to
do it if God gives the strength and the grace.”</p>

<p>“I like to think of that grand, earnest Saint
Paul, with his ‘thorn in the flesh.’ Perhaps it
was some giant temper or desire. I fancy it
must have been, for you know how he persecuted
the Christians unto death. And though God
would not take it away, there was the promise
of His grace being sufficient.”</p>

<p>“As it is, always.”</p>

<p>“There are some years to live before I decide
positively. But if they were spent in a worthy
manner, and I mean them to be, with God’s
help.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you could, surely. And papa would be
your best friend;” I rejoined eagerly.</p>

<p>“Keep my secret—I have your promise,” he
said in a hurried manner, for a step sounded on
the walk.</p>

<p>“It is sacred to me until you wish to take
others into your confidence.”</p>

<p>Stephen spoke and we turned, walking slowly
up to the house. Louis sat down on the step
beside papa. I stood undecided whether to go
in or not, when Stephen took my arm and drew
me around the corner of the porch. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
a long grape arbor whose gloom was made a
pleasant twilight by the silver sifted through
the openings between the leaves, and we took a
turn up and down.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you,” he began almost abruptly,
and his voice had a hard, strained sound, “that
I heard—the last of what you said. I could
not help it. And I know your secret.”</p>

<p>I was a trifle annoyed, but I controlled myself.</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, “then you will be tender and
helpful and do all in your power to strengthen
Louis. He feels so humble. I would hardly have
thought it of him. And there are so few young
men who have any desire to take such a life
upon them. With his means and his talents he
can do so much good.”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. “Rose, what are you
talking about?” he asked. “Did not Louis—”</p>

<p>“He confessed to me his desire—no, it was
hardly that, as he is afraid he can never be good
enough for a clergyman. But you <em>will</em> assist
him—you do not disapprove of it?”</p>

<p>“Louis! Ah, I understand. It would be the
delight of my heart. But I thought—I knew
he liked you so much. Oh, my little darling!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>He turned and gathered me in his arms. My
heart beat and my cheeks were in a blaze as
the whole story came to me, dazing me with its
strange, sweet suddenness. I believe I cried and
then I laughed hysterically, but somehow the
cool, steady voice quieted me and made me feel
the truth and earnestness of what he was saying,
so presently I grew still with a great awe.</p>

<p>“You will come,” he was saying. “We both
need you. We want just this steady, cheerful,
loving influence. I think I have a tendency to
be impatient when people cannot see my ways,
perhaps requiring a little too much, and your
sweetness will temper this. Then we can both
help him.”</p>

<p>Could I? How strange that any one should
care for me alone. Not for mamma, or Fanny,
but to want <em>me</em>!</p>

<p>“Mr. Duncan,” I began as we were going
back to the porch—“have you forgotten that
my hair is—red?”</p>

<p>“Well, what of that?” in a gay tone.</p>

<p>“I do not believe you—like it.”</p>

<p>“You foolish little girl, set your heart at rest.
Do you remember when I came upon you suddenly
last summer? You were standing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
the porch in a tiny glint of sunshine, and looked
like some of the old pictures! Why, I believe
it <em>was</em> your hair that I fell in love with first
of all.”</p>

<p>“I am glad it was, for I am not half as good
as you imagine I am.”</p>

<p>“Children,” mamma said, standing on the
porch step. “Do you realize how late it is?”</p>

<p>I felt that she knew all, perhaps had known
it long before, indeed. But I was glad that the
knowledge had come to me so suddenly, and
not any sooner. Even now I was half afraid of
it. Her kiss and tender clasp re-assured me.</p>

<p>“Mother!” Stephen Duncan said with reverent
sweetness.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I wished</span> there could be no such thing
as breakfast the next morning, but there
was, and I had to go through with it,
feeling that I was no longer I, that Rosalind
Endicott was some dream-girl of the past.
Stephen was very good and did not notice me
much, and Fan appeared wonderfully pre-occupied.
Mamma helped me over the trying places,
and papa just said with his tender morning kiss,—“And
this little girl, too.”</p>

<p>When I was all dressed for church I opened
a little drawer to get my gloves. There lay the
box containing Stephen’s gift. I had never worn
it, but it seemed to me as if I ought to put it
on now. He liked me and the misunderstandings
were at an end. I had accepted a share of
his burthens, his crosses, whatever they might
be, so I clasped it around my neck. It was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
beautiful. I did not envy the queen her diadem.</p>

<p>We walked to church together. Louis glanced
back now and then. I believe he began to suspect.</p>

<p>It was quite different from the Sunday when
I had gone to church with that strange sense of
Fan’s new love. I felt quiet and restful, yet it
was such a great thing to have another’s heart
in one’s keeping, to take in a new life beside
the old.</p>

<p>They both left us on Monday. Stephen was
to come up soon again. In the meanwhile, letters.</p>

<p>“I have one of yours to begin with,” he
whispered.</p>

<p>It was a silent day for us. No one appeared
to care about talking, yet we were not gloomy.
Indeed, I think mother, Fan and I understood
as we never had before, how much we loved
one another.</p>

<p>I went on wearing my cross. In the first
letter there came a pearl ring for me. Fan had
a handsome diamond but she seldom wore it except
when she was going to the Churchills. I
slipped mine on my finger with a slight presentiment
that I should turn the pearl inside if any
one looked at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p>Richard Fairlie and Jennie came home bright
and happy as birds. They took possession of
the great house, altered a little, re-arranged to
their liking and had Mrs. Ryder in their midst.
There was no grand party, but some pleasant
tea-drinkings and hosts of calls. No one could
afford to slight Mrs. Fairlie, and people began
to realize what a noble girl Jennie Ryder had
always been.</p>

<p>I am almost ashamed to confess how much
talking it took to settle our affairs. Stephen
wanted to be married in the Spring. That was
too soon, mamma and I thought. But there
were so many good reasons.</p>

<p>Miss Churchill heard of it presently and came
over to have a consultation with mamma.</p>

<p>“It will have to be sometime,” she said. “It
will make a little confusion, a break, and no
end of strangeness in adapting yourselves to the
new order. But here are Nellie and Daisy right
behind.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to lose all my girls in this
fashion,” said mamma.</p>

<p>Miss Churchill smiled and then admitted that
<em>she</em> had a plan to propose.</p>

<p>They wanted Fanny. The murder was out
then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span></p>

<p>“Kenton and I have discussed the matter a
good while. Winthrop will have the farm when
we are done with it—he is the only nephew.
Kenton has been sorry for some years that we
did not take him when his father died. He is
very fond of country life, and surely there are
enough to toil and moil in the cities. Then,
although Lucy was improved by her summer
trip, we can understand that it is <em>not</em> permanent.
She wears out slowly. I should like her to
have a happy year or two with Fanny, and I
should like the marriage well out of the way of
any sad memories.”</p>

<p>“You are very thoughtful,” returned mamma.</p>

<p>“And it will hardly be like parting with
Fanny, for you—as you can see her every day.
One thing and another has brought us so near
together. Kenton and I are growing old and
the presence of these young people will keep us
from getting too queer and whimsical.”</p>

<p>It was settled some time in January.</p>

<p>“We shall have to do the best we can,”
said mamma. “The wardrobes must be simple.
It is <em>our</em> station that they go out of, and we
never have been ashamed of our poverty.”</p>

<p>“What does a few clothes signify,” commented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
papa. “If the young men are not satisfied we
will give them a double portion of dry-goods and
keep our girls.”</p>

<p>Fan laughed over the idea.</p>

<p>So it was arranged that she and Fanny
should go to New York. I did not desire to
accompany them, and I was sure they could
choose as well for me as if I hunted the whole
town over. Besides, I wanted the nice quiet
time with papa, since I was the one who would
have to go away.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny!” said Fan. “I feel like the
heroine of some hundred year old novel, going
up to town to buy wedding clothes, instead of
a girl of the period of puffs, paniers, chignons,
Grecian bends, and all that! Why Rose, think
of it! We have never had a silk dress in all
our lives, except that once we had one ruffled
with an old one of mamma’s; and we have been
very tolerably happy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, just as happy as one need be. All
that could be crowded into our small lives.”</p>

<p>“I dare say we should be absolute curiosities
to some people. Everybody now-a-days has
a silk walking-suit, and some handsome thread
lace, and I don’t believe there are any <em>poor</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
people but just us. But then we have had the
love and comfort and enjoyment and no time to
worry about our rich neighbors. It has been a
life full of pleasantness and peace.”</p>

<p>That was true enough. There were many,
many things beside raiment, if one could only
get at the real completeness and harmony, the
secret of soul life.</p>

<p>Jennie Fairlie <em>would</em> help us sew. With their
good servant she declared she had nothing to do.
Miss Churchill sent us both an elegant poplin
suit, or at least the materials. It <em>was</em> a simple
wardrobe to be sure. One pretty light silk dress,
one dark silk with a walking-jacket. We made
morning robes and some inexpensive house garments.
Then it would be summer so soon, and
there was nothing equal to fresh, cool white.
We were not used to crying for the moon, we had
found early in life that it was quite a useless
proceeding.</p>

<p>Altogether we kept our secrets pretty well,
and when the truth leaked out at last, everybody
was so surprised that they could only
exclaim. Aunt Letty Perkins was brave enough
to come and see if it was really so.</p>

<p>“Well, I <em>am</em> beat!” she declared. “And doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
well, too! I always said there never was anyone
like Mis’ Endicott for luck. Girls often do
hang on so where there is a lot, and you’ve
enough left. Fanny <em>is</em> the flower of the family
to be sure, but she is making a big step to get
in with the Churchills. Ain’t afraid she’ll be
puffed up with pride and vanity, are you?”</p>

<p>“I think I can trust her,” replied mamma
with a funny smile in the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>I remember the morning as one recalls a half
dream, the misty impression between sleeping
and waking. The peculiar confusion pervading
the house, the strange mislaying of handkerchiefs
and gloves, the voices that were so full
of tears and gay little laughs, the half sentences,
the clasp of hands as one went in or out of a
room, the long, loving glances as if each would
fain garner all the past into one sweet remembrance.
Winthrop and Stephen, one rather grave
but very tender to mamma and the little ones,
the other full of life and vivacity, the happiest
of the happy.</p>

<p>Fan had one little say though her eyes were
bright with tears.</p>

<p>“I hope I can be as good and sweet in my
life as mamma has been in hers. And I will
not ask any higher happiness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span></p>

<p>We walked up the church aisle. The children
stood around, back of them Louis, Nelly
and mamma, and then a host of eager parish
faces. Does any one take it all in then, the solemn
questions, the still more solemn promises?</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill gave us both away. Papa’s
voice had a little falter in it, and I dared not
look up. “For better, for worse,” “till death do
us part,” rang clearly in heart and brain. The
forever of human love, when it <em>is</em> love and no
base counterfeit.</p>

<p>A little kissing, a few tears, some tremulous
whispers and sad, sad good-byes. We whose
farthest journey had been the brief sojourn at
Martha’s Vineyard, took up the great pilgrimage
of a new life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I cannot tell you anything about it, or Stephen.
It was a happy confusion of strange places and
watchful care, bits of affection shining out of
the tiniest rift. Honeymoons, I suppose, are
much alike, but it is right for each to think
his and hers the best and most delightful.</p>

<p>One afternoon the carriage set us down in so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
quiet a street that I could hardly believe it was
New York. And when I entered the house, <em>my</em>
new house, I doubted more than ever, for everybody
was there. One kissed me until I thought
the breath of life was surely gone, then another
took me up. I have a dim suspicion that my
sleeves were worn threadbare, and if my hair
had not been all fast in my head, I am afraid
the difference would have been discoverable.</p>

<p>“Why you are rounder and rosier than ever!”
declared Fan, inspecting me.</p>

<p>She was elegant as a princess, and had her
light silk dress trimmed with applique lace.</p>

<p>It seemed as if I never could get done looking
at mamma, and papa hovered around me as
if I was indeed an unusual sight.</p>

<p>Somehow I managed to get up-stairs to my
own pretty room, to wash my face, what there
was left of it, and straighten my gown. And
there was Beauty, my lovely half-grown kitten
that some one had brought from the old home.</p>

<p>I heard Stuart’s voice outside the door and
called him in.</p>

<p>“Stuart,” I said with much dignity, “this is
Miss Beauty Endicott, a nice, orderly, well
brought-up kitten, and <em>mine</em>. I want you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
respect her and treat her with the courtesy of
a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fudge!” he returned. “What are you
doing with a kitten when you are married? I
thought it was only old maids who were death
on cats.”</p>

<p>“It is boys who are death on cats,” I replied
severely. “And then—I never <em>did</em> expect to
be married. I always supposed—”</p>

<p>“Oh, you couldn’t have been an old maid!
your nose never <em>can</em> be sharp, and your chin
has that great dimple in it, and you are such a
funny little dumpling altogether! If you say
much I’ll put you in my pocket and carry you
off. No doubt Stephen would feel immensely
relieved, but what <em>could</em> the cat do?”</p>

<p>“You are an incorrigible boy!”</p>

<p>“But we will have jolly times for all that,”
and he whistled to Tim, who put her head within
the door.</p>

<p>“Fan,” I exclaimed with remorseful tenderness
as I was going down stairs with her arm
over my shoulder; “I have Mrs. Whitcomb.
But you know you half gave her to Stephen.
And as you are not to keep house—”</p>

<p>“I will lend her to you a little while longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span></p>

<p>We had such a merry, enjoyable supper, such
a lovely long evening, and were brimfull of
happiness.</p>

<p>But the next morning papa gathered up his
flock, “what there was left of them,” he said
with a certain comical grimace.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as you need lament,” answered
Stephen. “I think the sons are coming in
pretty rapidly.”</p>

<p>“And if there should be seven! Mother what
would we do with them all?”</p>

<p>Mamma smiled a little as Stephen went around
and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Remember that I am the first one; I will
never be crowded out of <em>my</em> place.”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered softly.</p>

<p>They all went away that noon, and left us
to begin our home life. We had talked it over,
what we were to do for the boys, what for ourselves,
and what for the world outside. For the
true life is not bounded with a narrow—thou
and I. The world takes us in, and over and
above all, God takes us in. His vineyard, His
day, and first and always His everlasting love.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">Handsomely Illustrated. Price per vol., $1.25. Sets in neat boxes.</p>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold wsp">VASCO DA GAMA:</p>

<p class="center no-indent wsp">HIS VOYAGES AND ADVENTURES.</p>

<p class="fs90">“Da Gama’s history is full of striking adventures, thrilling incidents, and
perilous situations; and Mr. Towle, while not sacrificing historical accuracy,
has so skilfully used his materials, that we have a charmingly romantic tale.”—<cite>Rural
New-Yorker.</cite></p>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold wsp">PIZARRO:</p>

<p class="center no-indent wsp">HIS ADVENTURES AND CONQUESTS.</p>

<p class="fs90">“No hero of romance possesses greater power to charm the youthful reader
than the conqueror of Peru. Not even King Arthur, or Thaddeus of Warsaw,
has the power to captivate the imagination of the growing boy. Mr.
Towle has handled his subject in a glowing but truthful manner; and we
venture the assertion, that, were our children led to read such books as this,
the taste for unwholesome, exciting, wrong-teaching boys’ books—dime
novels in books’ clothing—would be greatly diminished, to the great gain of
mental force and moral purpose in the rising generation.”—<cite>Chicago Alliance.</cite></p>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold wsp">MAGELLAN;</p>

<p class="center no-indent wsp">OR, THE FIRST VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.</p>

<p class="fs90">“What more of romantic and spirited adventures any bright boy could
want than is to be found in this series of historical biography, it is difficult
to imagine. This volume is written in a most sprightly manner; and the
life of its hero, Fernan Magellan, with its rapid stride from the softness of
a petted youth to the sturdy courage and persevering fortitude of manhood,
makes a tale of marvellous fascination.”—<cite>Christian Union.</cite></p>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold wsp">MARCO POLO:</p>

<p class="center no-indent wsp">HIS TRAVELS AND ADVENTURES.</p>

<p class="fs90">“The story of the adventurous Venetian, who six hundred years ago penetrated
into India and Cathay and Thibet and Abyssinia, is pleasantly and
clearly told; and nothing better can be put into the hands of the school boy
or girl than this series of the records of noted travellers. The heroism displayed
by these men was certainly as great as that ever shown by conquering
warrior; and it was exercised in a far nobler cause,—the cause of knowledge
and discovery, which has made the nineteenth century what it is.”—<cite>Graphic.</cite></p>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold wsp">RALEGH:</p>

<p class="center no-indent wsp">HIS EXPLOITS AND VOYAGES.</p>

<p class="fs90">“This belongs to the ‘Young Folks’ Heroes of History’ series, and deals
with a greater and more interesting man than any of its predecessors. With
all the black spots on his fame, there are few more brilliant and striking
figures in English history than the soldier, sailor, courtier, author, and explorer,
Sir Walter Ralegh. Even at this distance of time, more than two
hundred and fifty years after his head fell on the scaffold, we cannot read his
story without emotion. It is graphically written, and is pleasant reading,
not only for young folks, but for old folks with young hearts.”—<cite>Woman’s
Journal.</cite></p>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold wsp">DRAKE:</p>

<p class="center no-indent wsp">THE SEA-LION OF DEVON.</p>

<p class="fs90">Drake was the foremost sea-captain of his age, the first English admiral
to send a ship completely round the world, the hero of the magnificent
victory which the English won over the Invincible Armada. His career was
stirring, bold, and adventurous, from early youth to old age.</p>
